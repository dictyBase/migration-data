This folder contains newly curated data.
- strain info
- phenotypes
- plasmid info
- gene name, gene product, description

1. Not all fields in any annotation file might be filled for all annotations, as values are not always available. This is like the existing data. 
2. Strains are usually new strains. 
3. Phenotypes are typically annotated to the newly created strains, or to existing strains.

Data will be added with header row in Excel. Once committed, data files cannot change, so curators make sure data is correct.

STRAIN DATA NEEDS TO BE LOADED BEFORE PHENOTYPE DATA WHEN FILES HAVE THE SAME DATE!
