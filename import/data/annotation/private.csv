DDB_G0270866,"Note that the coding sequence of this gene does not end with a stop codon. However, the protein sequence is very conserved and the curated model most likely represents the correct sequence.// made private 7-FEB-2008 PF","possible sequence discrepancy (and wrote to Amos): I agree that the N-terminal extension is a bit weired considering the high degree of similarity. However, I cannot make another gene model based on our genomic sequence. There is a chance that it's a sequence mistake, where the sequence is ATGATTTTTATCTTAGATATTA, it could be that there is an extra T in the string of 5. So If it were ATGATTTTTTATCTTAGATATTA this would put the ATG in frame, and the N-terminus is at least about the same lenght, though it doesn't match up as nicely as the C-terminus now. That said, currently I cannot make a different model not having other compelling evidence for this theory. 7-FEB-2008 PF ","changed curated model as new geneID prediction gives an ugly but perfect last exon that ends exactly like the human ortholog - Amos thinks the N-terminal is too long and I agree, but don't see how to fix that 7-FEB-2008 PF","Verified and curated 26.

Therefore, it seems odd to annotate to 'CDK5 regulatory subunit associated protein' if there is no 'CDK5 regulatory subunit ' to be associated with.  Another confusing factor is that it gets picked up by an InterPro domain called 'RNA-i(6)A37 modification enzyme MiaB'  (IPR006463 ), and when I BLAST using the bacterial sequence  I get the cdk5rap1 gene back.

Df matches that FF-rich N-terminal, so more scant evidence for the SC gene pred start than for the geneID start.
