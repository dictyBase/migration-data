DDB_G0268642	Karen Kestin	Initiation of protein translation in eukaryotes is regulated by phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotictranslation initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha). During periods of amino acid starvation, eIF2alpha is inactivated viaphosphorylation by the serine/threonine kinase ([/ontology/go/0004674/annotation/page/1 protein serine/threonine kinase activity]) GCN2 (general control nonderepressible), also known asPEK (pancreatic eukaryotic translation initiation factor kinase). The PEK family of protein kinases is highly conservedfrom yeast to humans, however, the effect on translation in metazoans is global whereas GCN2 in yeast acts to inhibittranslation of specific species of mRNA ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7855893  reviewed in Wek 1994]).<br />In ''Dictyostelium'', two members of the PEK family of protein kinases have been identified: [/gene/DDB_G0272837 ifkA] and[/gene/DDB_G0276829 ifkB].

DDB_G0268020	Petra Fey	The oxidative decarboxylation of alpha-keto acids in the catabolism of the branched-chain amino acids (isoleucine, leucine, and valine), is catalyzed by the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex. This mitochondrial enzyme contains 3 catalytic components, E1, E2, and E3. E1 is a heterotetrameric alpha2 ([/gene/DDB_G0286335 bkdA]), beta2 ([/gene/DDB_G0268020 bkdB]) enzyme, with 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase activity ().<br /> E2 is a homo-24-meric dihydrolipoyl transacylase ([/gene/DDB_G0281797 bkdC]) that forms the core of the multienzyme and binds to both E1 and E3 ([/ontology/go/5515/annotation/page/1 protein binding]). The lipoyl group of E2 is reductively 2-methylpropanoylated by E1, and then passes this 2-methylpropanoyl to coenzyme A ([/ontology/go/8415/annotation/page/1 acyltransferase activity]). In addition to the 2-methylpropanoyl group, formed when E1 acts on the oxoacid that corresponds with valine, this enzyme also transfers the 3-methylbutanoyl and S-2-methylbutanoyl groups when E1 acts on the oxoacids corresponding with leucine and isoleucine, respectively.<br />The E3 enzyme ([/gene/DDB_G0291648 lpd]) is adihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase ([/ontology/go/4148/annotation/page/1 dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase activity]) that is shared by three 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase multienzyme complexes. These include the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, the glycine cleavage system, and the branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 02-DEC-2004 PF
DDB_G0271842	Petra Fey	 Succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS) is an enzyme in the [/ontology/go/0006099/annotation/page/1 tricarboxylic acid cycle] that catalyzes the formation of succinyl-CoA from succinate with the concomitant hydrolysis of NTP to NDP and phosphate. There are two forms of the enzyme, using either ATP or GTP. The [/gene/DDB_G0289325 scsA] gene encodes the succinyl-CoA synthetase alpha subunit. In eukaryotes one alpha and one beta subunit are thought to form a heterodimer. Anschutzt ''et al.'' determined that in crude [/ontology/go/0016020/annotation/page/1 membrane] extracts ScsA could be phosphorylated by ATP and GTP, but the purified enzyme showed high specificity for GTP ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8448193  Anschutz et al., 1993]). <br />Only one alpha subunit has been identified in ''Dictyostelium'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7771809  Birney and Klein, 1995]). However, two beta subunits are present in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome; [/gene/DDB_G0274449 scsB] is the ortholog of GDP-forming succinyl-CoA ligase beta subunits () and [/gene/DDB_G0271842 scsC] is highly similar to known ADP-forming succinyl-CoA ligase beta subunits ().Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 27-JAN-2005 PF

NIMA-related kinases havebeen cloned in several vertebrates, however, ''nek2'' represents the first identified non-vertebrate Nek2 kinase [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11956323 (Graf 2002)].<br />[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11956323 Graf (2002)] demostrates that ''Dictyostelium'' Nek2 localizes to the microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) ([/ontology/go/0005813/annotation/page/1 centrosome]), although acytoplasmic ([/ontology/go/0005737/annotation/page/1 cytoplasm]) pool of Nek2 also exists, similar to its vertebrate counterpart. Overexpression of a ''GFP:nek2'' fusion constructresults in abnormal nuclear morphology and supernumerary MTOCs ([/ontology/go/0007098/annotation/page/1 centrosome cycle]). Overexpression of a series ofdeletion constructs results in a supernumerary MTOC phenotype only when the C-terminal domain is expressed and not when thecatalytic kinase domain alone is expressed. This implies a centrosome nucleation function for the C-terminal domain([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11956323 Graf 2002]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 07-APR-2004 KP

Inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase, inositol monophosphate phosphatase, and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase share a sequence motif, Asp-Pro-(Ile or Leu)-Asp-(Gly or Ser)-(Thr or Ser), that has been shown by crystallographic and mutagenesis studies to bind metal ions and participate in catalysis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7761465 (York et al. 1995)]. <br />The ''Dictyostelium'' [/gene/DDB_G0270836 fbp] and [/gene/DDB_G0291648 lpd] protein sequences have been used in a phylogenetic analysisthat studied gene transfer between parasitic organisms and their hosts [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15003488 (Huang et al. 2004)].

DDB_G0271564	Karen Kestin	The net reaction of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, which then enters the tricarboxylic acidcycle (TCA).

DDB_G0270884	Petra Fey	Actobindin has been characterized in ''Acanthamoeba castellanii'' where it was shown to bind to two actin monomers ([/ontology/go/0003779/annotation/page/1 actin binding]) at high concentrations of G-actin [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2376577  (Vandekerckhove et al. 1990)]. Actobindins are small proteins with two actin-binding WH2 (Wiskott Aldrich syndrome homology region 2) domains. ''Dictyostelium'' has three genes encoding actobindin, [/gene/DDB_G0270884 abnA], [/gene/DDB_G0269518 abnB], and [/gene/DDB_G0269520 abnC]. While proteins are identical for ''abnB'' and ''abnC'', both are 72% identical to ''abnA''.

The proteins encoded by [/gene/DDB_G0274131 act17], [/gene/DDB_G0289489 act18], [/gene/DDB_G0268744 act23] and [/gene/DDB_G0289505 act24]are more divergent. <br />Actin is a major [/ontology/go/0005200/annotation/page/1 structural constituent of cytoskeleton]. Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in ''Dictyostelium'', constituting approximately 8% of the total protein in vegetative cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/561722 Alton and Lodish et al. 1977]).Actin synthesis is developmentally regulated, peaking shortly after starvation (reviewed by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6894564 Firtel] in 1981). The different actin genes differ in their levels of expression, with [/gene/DDB_G0274135 act6], [/gene/DDB_G0269234 act8] and [/gene/DDB_G0274129 act12] being highly expressed both during growth and development compared to [/gene/DDB_G0289005 act4], [/gene/DDB_G0289663 act5], [/gene/DDB_G0280545 act7] and [/gene/DDB_G0272248 act16] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6286214 McKeown and Firtel 1981]).

DDB_G0269242	Petra Fey	The ''fcsA'' gene was identified by screening expression libraries with monoclonal antibodies raised against purified phagosomal proteins. The gene encodes the LC FACS 1 protein, an enzyme with [/ontology/go/0004467/annotation/page/1 long-chain-fatty-acid-CoA ligase activity] and has been shown to localize to the cytosolic surface ([/ontology/go/0010009/annotation/page/1 external side of endosome membrane]) of the [/ontology/go/0005769/annotation/page/1 early endosome]. Long chain fatty acid acyl-CoA synthesases catalyse the formation of a thiester bond between a free fatty acid and coenzyme A during [/ontology/go/0006631/annotation/page/1 fatty acid metabolic process]. In a ''fcsA'' null mutant, growth development, phagocytosis, and macropinocytosis are all normal, however, fatty acid accumulation is strongly reduced. This suggests that the LC FACS 1 enzyme plays a role in the retrieval of fatty acids from the lumen of phagosomes into the cytosol [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14629118  (von Loehneysen et al., 2003)]. <br />Searching the cDNA database identified a gene, ([/gene/DDB_G0269474 fcsB]), coding for a protein which is 40% identical to LC FACS 1 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14629118  (von Loehneysen et al., 2003)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 10-MAR-2005 PF
DDB_G0269244	Petra Fey	The ''atg6'' gene was isolated among several members of the autophagy family of genes, conserved from yeast to man [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12626495  (Otto et al., 2003)]. Macroautophagy ([/ontology/go/0016236/annotation/page/1 macroautophagy]) is used by eukaryotic cells to recycle non-essential cellular components during starvation and development. In ''atg6''-null cells, survival during nitrogen starvation ([/ontology/go/0006995/annotation/page/1 cellular response to nitrogen starvation]) is reduced.. Upon starvation mutant cells show little turnover of cellular components. Development ([/ontology/go/0007275/annotation/page/1 multicellular organismal development]) of the mutant is slightly impaired. On bacterial lawns cells aggregate mainly in the center of plaques and not in the periphery, and multi-tipped aggregates form very small fruiting bodies ([/ontology/go/0009653/annotation/page/1 anatomical structure morphogenesis]). Axenically grown cells plated on filters form multi-tipped aggregates that develop into small fruiting bodies with truncated stalks. These fruiting bodies produce few viable, detergent-resistent spores ([/ontology/go/0030435/annotation/page/1 sporulation]). Wild-type cells in a chimaera do not rescue the developmental defects, showing that the atg6 mutation is autonomous. The phenotype of the ''atg6''-null mutant is almost identical to that of the [/gene/DDB_G0286191 atg8]-null mutant. Both mutants have the mildest defects when compared to [/gene/DDB_G0292390 atg1], [/gene/DDB_G0289881 atg5], and [/gene/DDB_G0271096 atg7] mutants [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14736886  (Otto et al., 2004)]Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 27-SEP-2004 PF

DDB_G0275115	Petra Fey	Succinate dehydrogenase, also known as complex II ([/ontology/go/5749/annotation/page/1 mitochondrial respiratory chain complex II]), catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate while FAD is reduced to FADH<sub>2</sub>. The enzyme contains 4 subunits: a flavoprotein (FP) ([/gene/DDB_G0280535 sdhA]), an iron-sulfur protein (IP) ([/gene/DDB_G0270120 sdhB]), and a cytochrome b composed of two integral membrane proteins ([/ontology/go/16021/annotation/page/1 integral to membrane]) ([/gene/DDB_G0275115 sdhC] and [/gene/DDB_G0278157 sdhD]). The 4 subunit complex is bound in the [/ontology/go/5740/annotation/page/1 mitochondrial envelope] and provides a link between the the [/ontology/go/6099/annotation/page/1 tricarboxylic acid cycle] and the membrane-bound [/ontology/go/6118/annotation/page/1 electron transport] system.

DDB_G0274449	Petra Fey	 Succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS) is an enzyme in the [/ontology/go/0006099/annotation/page/1 tricarboxylic acid cycle] that catalyzes the formation of succinyl-CoA from succinate with the concomitant hydrolysis of NTP to NDP and phosphate. There are two forms of the enzyme, using either ATP or GTP. The [/gene/DDB_G0289325 scsA] gene encodes the succinyl-CoA synthetase alpha subunit. In eukaryotes one alpha and one beta subunit are thought to form a heterodimer. Anschutzt ''et al.'' determined that in crude [/ontology/go/0016020/annotation/page/1 membrane] extracts ScsA could be phosphorylated by ATP and GTP, but the purified enzyme showed high specificity for GTP ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8448193  Anschutz et al., 1993]). <br />Only one alpha subunit has been identified in ''Dictyostelium'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7771809  Birney and Klein, 1995]). However, two beta subunits are present in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome; [/gene/DDB_G0274449 scsB] is the ortholog of GDP-forming succinyl-CoA ligase beta subunits () and [/gene/DDB_G0271842 scsC] is highly similar to known ADP-forming succinyl-CoA ligase beta subunits ().Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 27-JAN-2005 PF
DDB_G0275311	Pascale Gaudet	Citrate synthase catalyzes the condensation of acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate to citrate ([/ontology/go/4180/annotation/page/1 carboxypeptidase activity]).The mitochondrial form of this enzyme catalyses citrate synthesis in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle ([/ontology/go/6099/annotation/page/1 tricarboxylic acid cycle]), an important function in both energy generation and carbon assimilation. Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 30-AUG-2004 PG
DDB_G0290327	Pascale Gaudet	Transcription factor IIA (TFIIA) is one of several factors that form part of a transcription preinitiation complex along with [/gene/DDB_G0288257 rpb2], the TATA-box-binding protein (TBP, encoded by the [/gene/DDB_G0275617 tbpA] gene)and TBP-associated factors (TAFs) on the TATA-box sequence upstream of the initiation start site. TFIIA binds to TBP to stabilise TBP binding to the TATA element. In yeast, TFIIA is dispensable for accurate initiation of transcription but plays an important role in transcriptional activation, functioning as either an antirepressor or a coactivator. <br /> Human TFIIA and Drosophila TFIIA are composed of three subunits. The two larger subunits (alpha and beta) are encoded by the same gene and appear to be posttranslationally modified forms of a precursor protein. In yeast, two genes TOA1 and TOA2 are homologs of the large and the small subunits, respectively (reviewed by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9618449 Hampsey] in 1998). In ''Dictyostelium'', [/gene/DDB_G0290327 gtf2a1] encodes the large (alpha/beta) subunits and [/gene/DDB_G0285343 gtf2a2] encodes the small (gamma) subunit.

DDB_G0275029	Petra Fey	The 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex catalyzes the overall conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA and CO<sub>2</sub>. It contains multiple copies of 3 enzymatic components: E1, E2, and E3. E1 ([/gene/DDB_G0280353 odhA]) has 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase activity (). Multiple copies of E1 are bound to a core of dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase (E2), which also binds multiple copies of lipoamide dehydrogenase (E3). The lipoyl group of E2 ([/gene/DDB_G0275029 odhB]) is reductively succinylated by E1, and then passes this succinyl group to coenzyme A ([/ontology/go/4149/annotation/page/1 dihydrolipoyllysine-residue succinyltransferase activity]).<br />The E3 enzyme ([/gene/DDB_G0291648 lpd]) is adihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase ([/ontology/go/4148/annotation/page/1 dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase activity]) that is shared by three 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase multienzyme complexes.

DDB_G0278971	Pascale Gaudet	''dimA'' encodes a bZIP/bRLZ transcription factor. The ''dimA'' null mutant shows similar developmental defects to the [/gene/DDB_G0289329 dmtA] null mutant, which is defective in DIF-1 synthesis. The mutants exhibit abnormal [/ontology/go/0009653/annotation/page/1 anatomical structure morphogenesis], producing fruiting bodies with long, thin stalks, have defective prestalkO cell differentiation, and increased number of prespore cells, indicating that DimA and DmtA are involved in [/ontology/go/0045595/annotation/page/1 regulation of cell differentiation]. ''dimA'' has been proposed to be a transcriptional regulator required to integrate DIF-1 signaling and subsequent patterning during ''Dictyostelium'' development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14729573 Thompson et al. 2004]). Interestingly, although ''dimA'' mutants make more prespore cells, in chimeras with wild type cells they actually produce fewer spores. Therefore, loss of ''dimA'' is deleterious for [/ontology/go/0030435/annotation/page/1 sporulation] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15470429 Foster et al. 2004]).<br />The eukaryotic basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors ([/ontology/go/0006355/annotation/page/1 regulation of transcription, DNA-dependent]) are proteins that dimerize through their leucine repeats to form a coiled coil with two flanking alpha-helices that constitute the basic region that binds DNA ([/ontology/go/0003677/annotation/page/1 DNA binding])[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11017199 (Fujii et al. 2000)].

DDB_G0275445	Pascale Gaudet	Members of the Myb family of transcription factors are typically composed of two orthree imperfect repeats each of about 50 amino acids. These repeats fold into a variant ofthe helix-turn-helix motif and bind DNA ([/ontology/go/0003677/annotation/page/1 DNA binding]).The Myb motif has been well conserved during evolution (see [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10331990 Guo et al. 1999] and references therein).<br />''mybB'' was isolated a REMI mutant that does not aggregate upon starvation ([/ontology/go/0031152/annotation/page/1 aggregation involved in sorocarp development]). It has undetectable levels of [/gene/DDB_G0281545 acaA] transcript and no cAMP production. The expression pattern of ''mybB'' is consistent with its role in early development, peaking 2 hours after starvation. MybB functions in [/ontology/go/0043193/annotation/page/1 positive regulation of gene-specific transcription], being specifically required for the induction of adenylate cyclase expression in early development. Adenylate cyclase is responsible for cAMP production which mediates signaling during development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9620859 Otsuka and Van Haastert 1998]).Overexpression of ''mybB'' rescues the developmental arrest of [/gene/DDB_G0282375 amiB] cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10651904 Kon et al. 2000]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 07-MAY-2004 PG
DDB_G0275451	Karen Kestin	The ''alxA'' gene was identified as a homolog of mammalian Alix (<u>AL</u>G-2-<u>i</u>nteracting protein <u>X</u>, alsoreferred to as AIP1), which interacts with ALG-2 (<u>a</u>poptosis-<u>l</u>inked <u>g</u>ene 2). Mammalian Alix is known tobe involved in many biological processes, including apoptosis, membrane trafficking, and budding of the HIV virus ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15276209 Ohkouchi et al. 2004]). Murine Alix has been shown to interact with ''Dictyostelium'' [/gene/DDB_G0291081 pefA], a calcium-binding EF hand protein similar to mammalian ALG-2, but not with [/gene/DDB_G0293530 pefB] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11927596 Aubry et al. 2002]). The ''alxA'' transcript and encoded protein are expressed throughout development, with higer levels duringgrowth and early development and slightly lower expression during culmination. Immunoflourescence experiments showthat the AlxA protein localizes to the [/ontology/go/0005737/annotation/page/1 cytoplasm] and to the [/ontology/go/0005768/annotation/page/1 endosome] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15708561 Mattei et al. 2005]).<br />The ''alxA'' null mutant shows no significant phenotype under normal conditions, however, mutant cells display developmentalabnormalities in the presence of LiCl and in low concentrations of Ca2+. In the presence of 5 mM LiCl, ''alxA-'' cellsarrest at the loose aggregate stage or form fruiting body-like structures at the apex of aggregates ([/ontology/go/0009653/annotation/page/1 anatomical structure morphogenesis]). Similarly, ''alxA''null cells arrest at the aggregate stage in the presence of 200&amp;micro;M TMB-8, an antagonist of intracellular Ca2+, and inthe presence of a low concentration of Ca2+. Developmental arrest is of course seen in wild-type cells in the absence offree Ca2+, however, ''alxA-'' cells are hypersensitive to a reduction in free Ca2+ compared to wild-type. Thissuggests that AlxA is somehow involved in calcium signaling in the developmental program, which is interesting in light of thecalcium binding activities of ''Dictyostelium'' PefA and PefB ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15276209 Ohkouchi et al. 2004], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11481037 Ohkouchi et al. 2001]).<br />A second mutant constructed and analyzed by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15708561 Mattei et al. (2005)] showssimilar gross phenotypes. At the cellular level, ''alxA-'' cells suppress spore formation ([/ontology/go/0045881/annotation/page/1 positive regulation of sporulation])and promote differentiation into PstB cells, as shown by almost ubiquitous expression of the prestalk markers[/gene/DDB_G0277853 ecmA], [/gene/DDB_G0269132 ecmB], and [/gene/DDB_G0277141 cotC] in migrating slugs.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 10-SEP-2004 KP

DDB_G0276043	Karen Kestin	Initiation of protein translation in eukaryotes is regulated by phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotictranslation initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha). During periods of amino acid starvation, eIF2alpha is inactivated viaphosphorylation by the serine/threonine kinase ([/ontology/go/0004674/annotation/page/1 protein serine/threonine kinase activity]) GCN2 (general control nonderepressible), also known asPEK (pancreatic eukaryotic translation initiation factor kinase). The PEK family of protein kinases is highly conservedfrom yeast to humans, however, the effect on translation in metazoans is global whereas GCN2 in yeast acts to inhibittranslation of specific species of mRNA ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7855893  reviewed in Wek 1994]).<br />In ''Dictyostelium'', two members of the PEK family of protein kinases have been identified: [/gene/DDB_G0272837 ifkA] and[/gene/DDB_G0276829 ifkB]. Putative proteins belonging to the PEK family are: [/gene/DDB_G0276043 ifkC], [/gene/DDB_G0283065 DDB_G0283065], [/gene/DDB_G0268642 DDB_G0268642], [/gene/DDB_G0292734 DDB_G0292734], and [/gene/DDB_G0292734 DDB_G0292734].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 17-SEP-2004 KP
DDB_G0273059	Karen Kestin	Members of the casein kinase I (CK1) family ([/ontology/go/0004681/annotation/page/1 casein kinase I activity]) of serine/threonine kinases have been implicated in manycellular processes. Casein kinases have been shown to phosphorylate the 14-3-3 ([/gene/DDB_G0269138 fttB]) protein inmammals, play a role in Wnt signaling in ''Xenopus laevis'' and ''Caenorhabditis elegans'', and maintaincircadian rhythms in ''Drosophila melanogaster''. Additionally, CK1 plays a role in DNA repair ([/ontology/go/0006281/annotation/page/1 DNA repair])in ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' and ''Schizosaccharomyces pombe'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10880352 Moreno-Bueno et al. 2000]).<br />Two casein kinase I family members have been identified in ''Dictyostelium discoideum'', ''cak1'' and [/gene/DDB_G0292354 DDB_G0292354]. Cak1 is highly similar to CK1s in yeast and in metazoans. DDB0216336 is a putative caseinkinase I that is highly similar to the CK1 subfamily tau-tubulin kinase (TTBK) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12471243 Manninget al. 2002]). The Cak1 protein has been shown to phosphorylate casein when it is expressed in''E. coli'' cells, and localizes to both the cytoplasm ([/ontology/go/0005737/annotation/page/1 cytoplasm]) and the nucleus ([/ontology/go/0005634/annotation/page/1 nucleus]) inimmunofluorescence assays. Null mutations and overexpression of a dominant-negative form of Cak1 fail to produce viable cells, indicating that this protein may be essential for growth.Overexpression of wild-type Cak1 results in decreased sensitivity to the DNA-damaging agent hydroxyurea; this suggests a role for Cak1 in DNA repair ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10880352 Moreno-Bueno et al. 2000]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 05-MAY-2004 KP

The proteins encoded by [/gene/DDB_G0274131 act17], [/gene/DDB_G0289489 act18], [/gene/DDB_G0268744 act23] and [/gene/DDB_G0289505 act24]are more divergent. <br />Actin is a major [/ontology/go/0005200/annotation/page/1 structural constituent of cytoskeleton]. Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in ''Dictyostelium'', constituting approximately 8% of the total protein in vegetative cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/561722 Alton and Lodish et al. 1977]).Actin synthesis is developmentally regulated, peaking shortly after starvation (reviewed by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6894564 Firtel] in 1981). The different actin genes differ in their levels of expression, with [/gene/DDB_G0274135 act6], [/gene/DDB_G0269234 act8] and [/gene/DDB_G0274129 act12] being highly expressed both during growth and development compared to [/gene/DDB_G0289005 act4], [/gene/DDB_G0289663 act5], [/gene/DDB_G0280545 act7] and [/gene/DDB_G0272248 act16] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6286214 McKeown and Firtel 1981]).

DDB_G0276101	Karen Kestin	Members of the structural maintentance of chromosomes (SMC) family are involved in manybiological processes, including sister chromatid cohesion ([/ontology/go/0007064/annotation/page/1 mitotic sister chromatid cohesion]), chromosome condensation([/ontology/go/0007076/annotation/page/1 mitotic chromosome condensation]), and DNA repair ([/ontology/go/0006281/annotation/page/1 DNA repair]). In ''Dictyostelium'', as in all eukaryotes, six members of thisconserved family exist: [/gene/DDB_G0291752 smc1], [/gene/DDB_G0284499 smc2], [/gene/DDB_G0276101 smc3], [/gene/DDB_G0286403 smc4], [/gene/DDB_G0290919 smc5], and [/gene/DDB_G0288993 smc6]. These proteins contain globulardomains at either end, separated by a hinge domain. The SMC proteins are capable of formingthree different types of heterodimers: Smc1-Smc3, Smc2-Smc4, and Smc5-Smc6 (reviewed in[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12360193 Jessberger 2002]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 17-DEC-2004 KP
DDB_G0275695	Petra Fey	The ''ampA'' gene encodes a novel anti-adhesive-like protein ([/ontology/go/0007155/annotation/page/1 cell adhesion]) that inhibits premature cell agglutination during growth. The AmpA protein also modulates cell-cell ([/ontology/go/0016337/annotation/page/1 cell-cell adhesion]) and cell-substrate adhesion during development ([/ontology/go/0007275/annotation/page/1 multicellular organismal development]), when much of the protein is found extracellularly ([/ontology/go/0005576/annotation/page/1 extracellular region]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11884033  (Varney et al. 2002)]. During development ''ampA''-expressing cells are initially scattered throughout the entire aggregate. By the tip formation stage, however, the majority of ''ampA''-expressing cells are localized to the mound periphery, with only a few cells remaining scattered in the upper portion of the mound. In the final culminant, ''ampA'' is expressed only in the upper cup, lower cup, and basal disc [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11963653  (Casademunt et al. 2002)]. Analysis of cell type specific reporter gene expression during development of the ''ampA''-null strain identifies patterning defects that define two distinct roles for the AmpA protein in specifying cell fate ([/ontology/go/0007389/annotation/page/1 pattern specification process]). In the absence of a functional ''ampA''gene, cells prematurely specify as prespore cells, and prestalk cell differentiation and migration are delayed ([/ontology/go/0009653/annotation/page/1 anatomical structure morphogenesis]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11973270  (Varney et al. 2002)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 16-JUN-2003 PF

The subunits encoded by [/gene/DDB_G0275759 rpa1] (ortholog of ''S. cerevisiae RPA190''), [/gene/DDB_G0288449 rpc2] (''RPA135''), [/gene/DDB_G0268198 rpa43] (''RPA43''), [/gene/DDB_G0290909 rpa49] (''RPA49''), and [/gene/DDB_G0278263 rpa12] (''RPA12'') are unique to RNA polymerase I. Two subunits, [/gene/DDB_G0291362 rpc19] and [/gene/DDB_G0282339 rpa5] (''RPC19'' and ''RPC40'' in ''S. cerevisiae''), are common to RNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase III and correspond to subunits 3 and 11 of RNA polymerase II.

DDB_G0276945	Petra Fey	In search for ''Dictyostelium'' clathrin adaptor complexes (APs) cDNAs ''apm4'', [/gene/DDB_G0289247 apm1], and [/gene/DDB_G0277901 apm3], encoding proteins homologous to mammalian medium chain (mu) subunits, have been cloned. All APs are comprised of two large subunits, one medium size subunit, and one small subunit. ''Apm4'' encodes the medium chain of AP-4 ([/ontology/go/0030124/annotation/page/1 AP-4 adaptor complex]), which seems to be associated with the Golgi apparatus ([/ontology/go/0005794/annotation/page/1 Golgi apparatus]). The ''apm4'' protein (mu4) is 26% identical with the human mu4A, and is slightly larger (59 kD versus 50 kD). However, the existance of several other partial sequences homologous to AP-4 complexes in the ''Dictyostelium'' database and the presence of conserved residues potentially interacting with tyrosine-based sorting signals suggest that ''amp4'' truly encodes an AP-4 medium chain. Expression of ''apm4'' is developmentally regulated, sharply increasing at 12 hours, and peaking at 16 hours development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11179674  (de Chassey et al., 2001)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-SEP-2003 PF
DDB_G0276947	Karen Kestin	Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-assocated protein 1 (TRAP1) plays a role in many cellular processes, suchas cell cycle regulation, differentiation, and apoptosis, however, its exact molecular function is unknown.First identified by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12372338 Morita and colleagues (2002)], the ''Dictyostelium'' Trap1 protein localizes to the [/ontology/go/0030864/annotation/page/1 cortical actin cytoskeleton]. During theprestarvation response, Trap1 translocates to the [/ontology/go/0005739/annotation/page/1 mitochondrion], a process that is induced byhigh cell density and by conditioned medium, indicating that an extracellular factor regulates this process. Trap1 has also been observed in the [/ontology/go/0005730/annotation/page/1 nucleolus] and [/ontology/go/0031160/annotation/page/1 spore wall] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15652353 Yamaguchi et al. 2005]).<br />Inantisense RNA experiments, the reduction of Trap1 protein results in reduced growth rate and delayed development([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15507488 Morita et al. 2004]). Cells overexpressing Trap1 exhibitprecocious aggregation, however, development arrests before the tight mound stage. Changes in Trap1 expressionaffect the expression of [/gene/DDB_G0280531 lagC], [/gene/DDB_G0289073 csaA], and the prestarvation genes [/gene/DDB_G0285431 dia1] and ''dia3'', but not [/gene/DDB_G0273063 dscA-1] or [/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1].

DDB_G0276155	Petra Fey	The ''spnA'' gene was identified as a developmentally essential gene in a REMI screen. SpnA- cells aggregate and form mounds but fail to continue through morphogenesis ([/ontology/go/0006953/annotation/page/1 acute-phase response]). However, at 16 hours of development the mounds disaggregate to eventually form many small finger-like structures. Analysis of cell-type differentiation ([/ontology/go/0030154/annotation/page/1 cell differentiation]) showed that SpnA function is cell autonomous for prestalk differentiation, and cell non-autonomous for prespore differentiation.<br />''SpnA,'' encodes a bimodular protein with an N-terminal domain that shares substantial sequence homology with the heterotrimeric Galpha subunit family of GTP binding proteins ([/ontology/go/0005525/annotation/page/1 GTP binding]). The C-terminal domain shows strong homology to the Ser/Thr phosphatases of the PPC2 class. SpnA was shown to have Ser/Thr phosphatase activity ([/ontology/go/0004722/annotation/page/1 protein serine/threonine phosphatase activity]) in vitro, and mutational analysis identified the PPC2 domain to be essential for spnA function. The Galpha-like domain, on the other hand, seems to be required for ''spnA'' regulation and its targeting to membrane ruffles ([/ontology/go/0001726/annotation/page/1 ruffle]). These results suggest that spnA works as a GTP-regulated molecular switch in ''Dictyostelium'' development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9585512  (Aubry and Firtel, 1998)].

Three distinct zinc-containing RNA polymerases are found in eukaryotic nuclei: [/gene/DDB_G0275759 rpa1] for the ribosomal RNA precursor ([/ontology/go/0006360/annotation/page/1 transcription from RNA polymerase I promoter]), ([/ontology/go/0005736/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase I complex]), [/gene/DDB_G0279193 rpb1] for the mRNA precursor ([/ontology/go/0006366/annotation/page/1 transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter]), ([/ontology/go/0005665/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase II, core complex]), and [/gene/DDB_G0277199 rpc1] for 5S and tRNA genes ([/ontology/go/0006383/annotation/page/1 transcription from RNA polymerase III promoter]), ([/ontology/go/0005666/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase III complex]).<br />RNA polymerase I is a multisubunit complex. The subunits encoded by [/gene/DDB_G0275759 rpa1] (ortholog of ''S. cerevisiae RPA190''), [/gene/DDB_G0288449 rpc2] (''RPA135''), [/gene/DDB_G0268198 rpa43] (''RPA43''), [/gene/DDB_G0290909 rpa49] (''RPA49''), and [/gene/DDB_G0278263 rpa12] (''RPA12'') are unique to RNA polymerase I. Two subunits, [/gene/DDB_G0291362 rpc19] and [/gene/DDB_G0282339 rpa5] (''RPC19'' and ''RPC40'' in ''S. cerevisiae''), are common to RNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase III and correspond to subunits 3 and 11 of RNA polymerase II. Subunits [/gene/DDB_G0291636 rpb5], [/gene/DDB_G0291037 rpb6], [/gene/DDB_G0278039 rpb8], [/gene/DDB_G0272036 rpb10], and [/gene/DDB_G0283365 rpb12] are common to all three RNA polymerases. Yeast has two additional subunits, ''RPA34'' and ''RPA14'', that do not have clear orthologs in other species, including in ''Dictyostelium'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12407181 Peyroche et al. 2002], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12381659 Schramm and Hernandez 2001]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 13-APR-2004 PG
DDB_G0277539	Karen Kestin	The wee1 family of tyrosine kinases ([/ontology/go/0004713/annotation/page/1 protein-tyrosine kinase activity]) were originally identified in a screen formutants that undergo mitosis at a reduced cell size in the fission yeast ''Schizosaccharomycespombe'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7262540 Nurse and Thuriaux 1980]). Since then, members ofthe wee1 family have been shown to play an essential role in cell cycle regulation ([/ontology/go/0000074/annotation/page/1 regulation of progression through cell cycle]) in several other organisms, including thebudding yeast ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'', the African clawed frog ''Xenopus laevis'', andseveral metazoans ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14625382 reviewed in Kellogg 2003]).<br />Wee1 phosphorylates a specific tyrosine residue on the mitosis promoting protein Cdk1/Cdc2/Cdc28 ([/gene/DDB_G0272813 cdk1] in ''Dictyostelium''). Phosphorylation of this residue by Wee1 inhibits Cdk1/Cdc2/Cdc28,thereby delaying entry into mitosis from G2. Cdk1/Cdc2/Cdc28 is inactivated by dephosphorylation of thetyrosine residue by the phosphatase Cdc25/Mih1 ([/gene/DDB_G0283617 cdc25] in ''Dictyostelium''), allowingentry into mitosis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14625382 reviewed in Kellogg 2003]).<br />Three uncharacterized putative wee1 family members exist in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome: [/gene/DDB_G0291842 DDB_G0291842], [/gene/DDB_G0277539 DDB_G0277539], and [/gene/DDB_G0291133 DDB_G0291133].

DDB_G0275573	Karen Kestin	Vps (Vacuolar Protein Sorting, named Snf7 in yeast and CHMP4 in human) proteins are involved in vesicle traffickingin yeast and in metazoans. Vps32 is an E class Vps involved in endosomal maturation (reviewed in [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10873832 Lemmon and Traub 2000]) and is a member of the [/ontology/go/0000815/annotation/page/1 ESCRT III complex] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12194857 Babst et al. 2002]). A ''Dictyostelium'' homolog of Vps32 was identified by[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15708561 Mattei et al.

DDB_G0277861	Petra Fey	PAT1 is a calcium-translocating P-type ATPase ([/ontology/go/0005388/annotation/page/1 calcium-transporting ATPase activity]), the type IIB ATPase which is responsible for translocating calcium ions across the plasma membrane ([/ontology/go/0006816/annotation/page/1 calcium ion transport]). ''Dictyostelium'' PAT1 is very similar to other Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPases of the plasma membrane, and ''patA'' gene expression is upregulated when cells are grown in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-rich medium. The rate of intracellular P-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake is also increased ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7499325 Moniakis et al., 1995]). Upregulation of ''patA'' expression is strongly reduced when the serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin ([/gene/DDB_G0276883 canA], [/gene/DDB_G0267446 cnbA]) was inhibited, suggesting the regulation of PAT1 by calcineurin ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9885293 Moniakis et al., 1999]).<br />PAT1-deficient cells, due to antisense expression of ''patA'' RNA or to the presence of calcineurin inhibitors, grow normally in low Ca<sup>2+</sup> medium but poorly in high Ca<sup>2+</sup> medium. PAT1 colocalizes with calmodulin ([/gene/DDB_G0279407 calA]) to the [/ontology/go/0031164/annotation/page/1 contractile vacuolar membrane] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7499325 Moniakis et al., 1995]), and also localizes to the [/ontology/go/0005886/annotation/page/1 plasma membrane]. These findings suggest that the contractile vacuole fuses with the plasma membrane to eliminate excess intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and maintain Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9885293 Moniakis et al., 1999]).

DDB_G0279911	Pascale Gaudet	NdkM is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial ([/ontology/go/0005739/annotation/page/1 mitochondrion]) NDP kinase ([/ontology/go/0004550/annotation/page/1 nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity])[/ontology/go/0009142/annotation/page/1 nucleoside triphosphate biosynthetic process]. Isolated ''Dictyostelium discoideum'' mitochondria contain 3% of the total cellular NDP kinase activity. The nascent mitochondrial NDP kinase contains a presequence of 57 amino acids that is removed during import into the mitochondria. Analysis of gene structure suggests that the ''ndkM'' and [/gene/DDB_G0273069 ndkC-1] genes probably diverged from a common ancestor [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8244981 (Troll et al.1993)].

DDB_G0278735	Karen Kestin	Bisphosphonates are used to treat various bone diseases, including osteoporosis and hypercalcemia. The effects ofbisphosphonate drugs on ''Dictyostelium'' resemble the effects on osteoclasts, making ''Dictyostelium'' anideal system in which to study bisphosphonates, particularly because osteoclasts are difficult to culture([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15332174 reviewed in Rogers 2004]). After some experimentation, it was discoveredthat the target for these drugs is [/gene/DDB_G0278735 fps] ([/ontology/go/0045337/annotation/page/1 farnesyl diphosphate biosynthetic process]). Other potential targets are alsoinvolved in lipid metabolism: isopentenyl diphospate isomerase [/gene/DDB_G0290011 ipi] and squalene synthase [/gene/DDB_G0292072 fdfT] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10804029 Grove et al. 2000]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 02-FEB-2005 KP
DDB_G0278737	Karen Kestin	The ''rckA'' gene, identified by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12686622 Sun and Firtel (2003)], encodes a protein that contains anRGS (regulator of G protein signaling) domain and a protein kinase domain ([/ontology/go/0004672/annotation/page/1 protein kinase activity]) that is similar to bothserine/threonine and tyrosine kinases. The ''rckA'' transcript is expressed at very low levels in vegetative cells, has a sharpincrease at 4 h and a sharp decline immediately after that point. A myc-tagged RckA resides in the cytoplasm ([/ontology/go/0005737/annotation/page/1 cytoplasm]),however, in response to a cAMP gradient, the protein translocates to the cell cortex ([/ontology/go/0005938/annotation/page/1 cell cortex]).<br />Disruption of the ''rckA'' gene results in precocious aggregation, however, slug formation is delayed. Conversely, cellsoverexpressing ''rckA'' have delayed aggregation. Expression of the cAMP receptor [/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1] is not affected in mutantcells, however, expression of the cell-type-specific markers [/gene/DDB_G0277141 cotC], [/gene/DDB_G0289075 spiA], [/gene/DDB_G0277853 ecmA], and[/gene/DDB_G0269132 ecmB] is delayed. Expression of RckA bearing key point mutations in the RGS and kinase domains results in aphenotype similar to ''rckA-'' cells. Interestingly, expression of RckA-E510G (a single mutation in the RGS domain) in ''rckA-'' cells functions to complement the null phenotype. This suggests that RckA-E510G has a low level of activity compared towild-type RckA. In addition to developmental defects, ''rckA-'' cells exhibit an increased rate of chemotaxis toward a cAMPgradient, while ''rckA'' overexpressors have a reduced rate.<br />In an attempt to elucidate the underlying signaling pathway in which RckA works, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12686622 Sun and Firtel (2003)] investigated interaction with several signaling molecules. The phosphatidylinositol pathway does not appear to berelated as shown with experiments involving [/gene/DDB_G0278727 pikA], [/gene/DDB_G0283081 pikB], and [/gene/DDB_G0268620 pkbA]. RckA does in factinteract genetically with G protein alpha subunits ([/ontology/go/0007189/annotation/page/1 G-protein signaling, adenylate cyclase activating pathway]). In [/gene/DDB_G0276267 gpaB] (G&amp;alpha;2) null cells, the RckA proteindoes not translocate to the membrane, nor does it retain kinase activity. In contrast, translocation and kinase activity areunchanged in [/gene/DDB_G0286185 gpaE] (G&amp;alpha;5) null cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12686622 Sun and Firtel 2003]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 03-DEC-2004 KP
DDB_G0276417	Karen Kestin	The net reaction of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, which then enters the tricarboxylic acidcycle (TCA).

E2 ([/gene/DDB_G0277847 pdhC]) forms the core of thecomplex and possesses dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase activity ([/ontology/go/0004742/annotation/page/1 dihydrolipoyllysine-residue acetyltransferase activity]).

In addition, the pyruvatedehydrogenase complex contains component X ([/gene/DDB_G0271564 pdhX]) that binds E3 ([/ontology/go/0005515/annotation/page/1 protein binding]) and has an apparent structural rolein the complex (reviewed in [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9399911 Aral et al. 1997]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 01-DEC-2004 KP
DDB_G0279977	Karen Kestin	Members of the p53-related/BUD32 family of serine/threonine protein kinases ([/ontology/go/0004674/annotation/page/1 protein serine/threonine kinase activity]) are amongst theshortest protein kinases, with protein lengths less than 300 amino acids. BUD32 was first identified in ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' in a severe growth mutant, and it has been shown experimentally to phosphorylatecasein and osteopontin in a Mn2+ dependent manner ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9305753 Stocchetto et al.1997]). A highly related protein was later found in mammalian systems, however, it is not functionallycomplementary to yeast BUD53. This protein, named p53-related protein kinase (PRPK), phosphorylates the tumorsuppresor p53 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11546806 Abe et al. 2001]).

DDB_G0277833	Petra Fey	''Dictyostelium'' cofilin was identified through a search for actin monomer binding proteins ([/ontology/go/0003785/annotation/page/1 actin monomer binding]) in whole cell lysates. A 15 kDa protein was isolated and purified, which was shown to depolimerize actin filaments ([/ontology/go/0030042/annotation/page/1 actin filament depolymerization]) in a dose-dependent manner and to decrease the viscosity of actin filaments. This activity was inhibited by phosphatidylinositides. Cloning the cofilin gene resulted in the identification of 2 identical genes, ''cofA'' and [/gene/DDB_G0291970 cofB] that differed only in their intron and promoter sequence. When promoter activities were tested, only ''cofA'' was found to be expressed, predominantly in vegetative cells. No promoter activity was detected for ''cofB'', suggesting that ''cofB'' might be a pseudogene. Attempts to delete the ''cofA'' gene failed, while deletion of ''cofB'' yielded mutants with no detectable phenotype. This confirmed that ''cofB'' is not expressed and suggested that ''cofA'' is an essential gene [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7738034  (Aizawa et al., 1995) ]. <br />Overexpression of ''cofA'' was shown to stimulate bundling of actin filaments ([/ontology/go/0051017/annotation/page/1 actin filament bundle formation]) in alpha-actinin ([/gene/DDB_G0268632 abpA]) -induced actin latticeworks, probably by severing the filaments [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8636212  (Aizawa et al., 1996) ]. In overexpressing cells also showed that cofilin, together with the actin-interacting protein [/gene/DDB_G0278733 DAip1], plays a pivotal role in reorganizing the actin bundles in response to hyperosmotic stress ([/ontology/go/0006972/annotation/page/1 hyperosmotic response]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10421841  (Aizawa et al., 1999) ]. To investigate the actin depolimerization activity of cofilin further, Ichetovkin ''et al.'' showed, by two independent methods, that both native and recombinant cofilin sever actin filaments ([/ontology/go/0006972/annotation/page/1 hyperosmotic response]), but to different extents [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10744862  (Ichetovkin et al., 2000) ].<br />Recently, cofilin was found to be dependent on the MADS box transcription factor [/gene/DDB_G0281387 srfA]. The authors found an expression profile of cofilin that differed from that published for ''cofA''. While ''cofA'' expression was originally tested by promoter activity and later confirmed by western blot, this analysis was done by Northern blot. As a consequence of the discrepancy the authors referred in their paper not to cofilin A, but to the identical cofilin B ([/gene/DDB_G0291970 cofB]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15075287  (Escalante et al., 2004) ].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 21-MAY-2004 PF

Subunits 5, 6, 8, 10, and 12 are common to all threeRNA polymerases. <br />A unique feature of the largest RNA polymerase II subunit is thepresence of tandem repeats of a heptapeptide sequence at its carboxy-terminus. This carboxy-terminal repeat domain(CTD) has the consensus sequence Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser is highly conserved among eukaryotic organisms. Althoughthe CTD is a ubiquitous feature of RNA pol II, the repeat length varies.It probably projects out of the globular catalytic domain and may interact with the acidic activator domains of transcriptional regulatory proteins. It is also known to bind by intercalation to DNA.

DDB_G0280047	Petra Fey	The ''yelA'' gene was isolated from REMI mutant DG1014. This developmental gene has been found to play an essential role in regulating terminal differentiation in ''Dictyostelium''. The yelA- mutant aggregates and develops normally until the mound stage, but does not proceed to form fingers or migrating slugs. Over the following 10 to 20 hours the mounds accumulate a bright yellow pigment typical for the sorus at the top of the fruiting body ([/ontology/go/0009653/annotation/page/1 anatomical structure morphogenesis]). Detergent resistant spores are formed ([/ontology/go/0030435/annotation/page/1 sporulation]) after only 16 hours of development, at least 4 hours earlier than in wild-type populations.The N-terminal sequence of the predicted yelA protein shows significant similarity to domains found in the eIF-4G subunits of the translational initiation complex eIF-4F. In wild-type development the ''yelA'' mRNA acccumulates after 8 hours and is maintained in both prespore and prestalk cells until culmination, after which it is found in stalk cells only. YelA mutations can partially supress the block to sporulation in the prestalk gene mutants [/gene/DDB_G0293002 tagA] and [/gene/DDB_G0286119 tagB]. These experiments suggest that yelA inhibits premature encapsulation until a signal from prestalk cells is received.

All members contain a putative transmembrane domain ([/ontology/go/0016021/annotation/page/1 integral to membrane]), and with the exception of [/gene/DDB_G0285895 gdt5] and [/gene/DDB_G0292314 gdt7], contain a putative protein kinase domain ([/ontology/go/0004672/annotation/page/1 protein kinase activity]) that is similar to the MLK (mixed-lineagekinase) family. Both [/gene/DDB_G0278723 gdt1] and [/gene/DDB_G0270666 gdt2] have been previously characterized, however, [/gene/DDB_G0278723 gdt1] lacks a conserved catalytic residue and therefore may not function as a kinase. Similarly, the [/gene/DDB_G0270544 gdt6]protein lacks this essential residue found in [/gene/DDB_G0270666 gdt2], [/gene/DDB_G0285891 gdt3], [/gene/DDB_G0270550 gdt4], and [/gene/DDB_G0270668 gdt8] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15236669 Chibalina et al. 2004]).<br />The ''gdt1'' gene was identified by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10793140 Zeng et al. (2000)] in a screen for mutantsdefective in discoidin ([/gene/DDB_G0273063 dscA-1], [/gene/DDB_G0273065 dscC-1], [/gene/DDB_G0273067 dscD-1]) production. The ''gdt1'' transcript is found in growing cells, however, it rapidly disappears atthe onset of development. Disruption of the ''gdt1'' locus results in constitutively expressed discoidin at high levels and premature aggregation incomparison to wild-type, in which discoidin expression coincides with the transition between growth and development. This suggests that Gdt1 functions in the repression of discoidin during the growth phase ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10793140 Zeng et al. 2000]).<br />Null mutants of both [/gene/DDB_G0276267 gpaB] (G protein alpha 2) and [/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC] (protein kinase A) exhibit an absence ofdiscoidin expression and fail to aggregate in response to starvation. Double mutants ''gdt1-/gpaB-'' and ''gdt1-/pkaC-''are also defective in aggregation, however, these mutants express discoidin at an elevated level, similar to ''gdt1'' null cells([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10793140 Zeng et al. 2000], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11270120 Zeng et al.2001]). In addition, the Gdt1 protein contains a PKA phosphorylation site that is phosphorylated by pkaC ''in vitro'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11270120 Zeng et al.2001]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 10-SEP-2004 KP
DDB_G0280495	Petra Fey	Fumarate hydratase is an enzyme of the [/ontology/go/0006099/annotation/page/1 tricarboxylic acid cycle] that hydrates fumarate into malate ([/ontology/go/0004333/annotation/page/1 fumarate hydratase activity]). The holoenzyme consists of a homotetramer. While bacteria have 3 different fumarases there is one in ''Dictyostelium'' and animals, which belong to the class-II fumarase family and are found in the [/ontology/go/0005739/annotation/page/1 mitochondrion] and in the [/ontology/go/0005737/annotation/page/1 cytoplasm]. In rat it has been shown that the mitochondrial and cytosolic fumarases are synthesized from the same mRNA by alternative translational initiation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1633825  (Suzuki et al., 1992)]. ESTs support that there are two isoforms in ''Dictyostelium''. The longer isoform contains a putative mitochondrial targeting sequence that is absent in the cytosolic isoform, which is 19 amino acids shorter at the N-terminus.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 01-FEB-2005 PF
DDB_G0280111	Karen Kestin	Members of the NAK (Numb-associated kinase) family of serine/threonine kinases ([/ontology/go/0004674/annotation/page/1 protein serine/threonine kinase activity]) have been shown toparticipate in diverse cellular processes. The first characterized NAK was the ''Drosophila melanogaster'' NAK,named for its ability to interact with the neuronal differentiation protein Numb, hence the name NAK ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9418906 Chien et al. 1998]). Additional members of this family include AAK1 (AP2-associatedkinase), involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11877461 Conner and Schmid 2000]),and BIKe (BMP-induced kinase), which plays a role in bone differentiation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11500515 Kearns et al. 2001]). [/gene/DDB_G0276461 DDB_G0276461] and DDB0229350 are similar to the kinasedomains of AAK1 and BIKe. The NAK family also includes MPSK (myristoylated and palmitoylated serine/threoninekinase), which is fatty acid acylated ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10364453 Berson et al. 1999]) andmay play a role in TGF-beta signaling ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10947953 Ohta et al. 2000]). The mostclosely related protein to MPSK in ''Dictyostelium discoideum'' is [/gene/DDB_G0291350 DDB_G0291350].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 10-MAY-2004 KP
DDB_G0282237	Pascale Gaudet	The DDT domain is predicted to be a DNA binding domain. The DDT domain is named after (DNA binding homeobox and Different Transcription factors).

DDB_G0280353	Petra Fey	The 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex catalyzes the overall conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA and CO<sub>2</sub>. It contains multiple copies of 3 enzymatic components: E1, E2, and E3. E1 ([/gene/DDB_G0280353 odhA]) has 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase activity (). Multiple copies of E1 are bound to a core of dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase (E2), which also binds multiple copies of lipoamide dehydrogenase (E3). The lipoyl group of E2 ([/gene/DDB_G0275029 odhB]) is reductively succinylated by E1, and then passes this succinyl group to coenzyme A ([/ontology/go/4149/annotation/page/1 dihydrolipoyllysine-residue succinyltransferase activity]).<br />The E3 enzyme ([/gene/DDB_G0291648 lpd]) is adihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase ([/ontology/go/4148/annotation/page/1 dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase activity]) that is shared by three 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase multienzyme complexes. These include the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, the glycine cleavage system, and the branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 03-DEC-2004 PF
DDB_G0281863	Karen Kestin	The Slob (Slowpoke-binding protein) family of protein kinases ([/ontology/go/0004672/annotation/page/1 protein kinase activity]) was originally identified in ''Drosophilamelanogaster'' as a binding partner with Slowpoke, a calcium-dependent potassium channel protein ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10230800 Zhou etal. 1999], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15234468 Zeng et al. 2004]). Similar proteins have alsobeen identified in mammals; these contain PX (phox) domains involved in intracellular signaling. Two putative Slobfamily sequences exist in the ''Dictyostelium'' proteome. [/gene/DDB_G0281863 slob1] contains an FYVE domain (namedfor the proteins in which it has been found: Fab1, YOTB, Vac1, and EEA1), which is involved in zinc ion binding ([/ontology/go/0008270/annotation/page/1 zinc ion binding]), and a WH2 domain, which has been shown to interact with actin. [/gene/DDB_G0279303 slob2], similar toDDB0229842, contains a proline-rich region near the C-terminus in addition to a kinase-like domain.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 29-SEP-2004 KP
DDB_G0280535	Petra Fey	Succinate dehydrogenase, also known as complex II ([/ontology/go/5749/annotation/page/1 mitochondrial respiratory chain complex II]), catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate while FAD is reduced to FADH<sub>2</sub>. The enzyme contains 4 subunits: a flavoprotein (FP) ([/gene/DDB_G0280535 sdhA]), an iron-sulfur protein (IP) ([/gene/DDB_G0270120 sdhB]), and a cytochrome b composed of two integral membrane proteins ([/ontology/go/16021/annotation/page/1 integral to membrane]) ([/gene/DDB_G0275115 sdhC] and [/gene/DDB_G0278157 sdhD]). The 4 subunit complex is bound in the [/ontology/go/5740/annotation/page/1 mitochondrial envelope] and provides a link between the the [/ontology/go/6099/annotation/page/1 tricarboxylic acid cycle] and the membrane-bound [/ontology/go/6118/annotation/page/1 electron transport] system. It is part of the respiratory chain and repressed in anaerobic respiration.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 31-JAN-2005 PF
DDB_G0280545	Pascale Gaudet	There are 29 genes encoding actin in ''Dictyostelium'' with amino acid identity greater than 83%, ''act1''-''act29''. Seventeen of these genes encode identical proteins: [/gene/DDB_G0289553 act1], [/gene/DDB_G0274133 act2], [/gene/DDB_G0289005 act4], [/gene/DDB_G0289663 act5], [/gene/DDB_G0274135 act6], [/gene/DDB_G0280545 act7], [/gene/DDB_G0269234 act8], [/gene/DDB_G0274601 act9], [/gene/DDB_G0288879 act11], [/gene/DDB_G0274129 act12], [/gene/DDB_G0274599 act13], [/gene/DDB_G0274137 act14], [/gene/DDB_G0272520 act15], [/gene/DDB_G0272248 act16], [/gene/DDB_G0274727 act19], [/gene/DDB_G0274285 act20], and [/gene/DDB_G0274561 act21], while [/gene/DDB_G0289811 act10], [/gene/DDB_G0275023 act22], and [/gene/DDB_G0289487 act3] respectively have 1, 4 and 11 amino acid differences compared to the 17 identical genes. The proteins encoded by [/gene/DDB_G0274131 act17], [/gene/DDB_G0289489 act18], [/gene/DDB_G0268744 act23] and [/gene/DDB_G0289505 act24]are more divergent. <br />Actin is a major [/ontology/go/0005200/annotation/page/1 structural constituent of cytoskeleton]. Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in ''Dictyostelium'', constituting approximately 8% of the total protein in vegetative cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/561722 Alton and Lodish et al. 1977]).Actin synthesis is developmentally regulated, peaking shortly after starvation (reviewed by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6894564 Firtel] in 1981). The different actin genes differ in their levels of expression, with [/gene/DDB_G0274135 act6], [/gene/DDB_G0269234 act8] and [/gene/DDB_G0274129 act12] being highly expressed both during growth and development compared to [/gene/DDB_G0289005 act4], [/gene/DDB_G0289663 act5], [/gene/DDB_G0280545 act7] and [/gene/DDB_G0272248 act16] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6286214 McKeown and Firtel 1981]).

DDB_G0283265	Petra Fey	''mkkA'' was identified in a PCR screen for MEK kinases, and found to be a single developmentally regulated transcript, not detectable in vegetative cells and induced during early development. The MEKK&amp;alpha; protein contains a conserved F-box, known for its role in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, followed by 5 WD40 repeats. Compared to wild-type, ''mkkA''-null cells developed more rapidly and formed fruiting bodies ([/ontology/go/0030587/annotation/page/1 sorocarp development]) with longer stalks and smaller sori ([/ontology/go/0009653/annotation/page/1 anatomical structure morphogenesis]). In the slug stage the null mutant shows an increase in the pstO compartment and a concomitant reduction in the prespore domain. Cells expressing a dominant-negative MEKK&amp;alpha; containing a L199A mutation in the putative ATP binding site had a similar but stronger morphological phenotype. In contrast, cells overexpressing MEKK&amp;alpha; or MEKK&amp;alpha;&amp;Delta;WD (lacking the WD40 repeats) showed very delayed development, which often arrested at the mound stage. Cells overexpressing only the F-box/WD40 repeats had a similar but more severe phenotype. Aberrant fruiting body formation and reduced spore production in these mutants suggest that MEKK&amp;alpha; plays an important role in prespore cell differentiation. <br />The Wd40 repeats were shown to target MEKK&amp;alpha; to the cortex ([/ontology/go/0005938/annotation/page/1 cell cortex]). Two-hybrid screens using the F-box/WD40 repeats as bait identified two proteins of the ubiqination/deubiquination pathway, [/gene/DDB_G0275021 ubpB], a ubiquitin hydrolase, and [/gene/DDB_G0284865 ubcB], a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. ''ubpB'' and ''ubcB'' were shown to differentially control MEKK&amp;alpha; through the F-box/WD40 repeats in a cell-type specific and temporally regulated manner [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9832508  (Chung et al., 1998)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-OCT-2004 PF
DDB_G0281387	Pascale Gaudet	''srfA'' encodes a MADS-box transcription factor ([/ontology/go/0003700/annotation/page/1 transcription factor activity]), ([/ontology/go/0006357/annotation/page/1 regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter]). The expression of ''srfA'' is developmentally regulated. The mRNA is present in vegetative cells, undetectable in aggregating cells up to the mound stage, and peaks in the late culminant.''srfA'' expression is controlled by alternative promoters in prestalk and prespore cells and is dependent on [/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9729488 Escalante and Sastre 1998], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11437439 Escalante et al. 2001], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12204259 Escalante and Sastre 2002])<br />Disruption of ''srfA'' leads to defects in [/ontology/go/0030435/annotation/page/1 sporulation] that affects spore viability.

Moreover, ''srfA'' null cells have defects in [/ontology/go/0030036/annotation/page/1 actin cytoskeleton organization and biogenesis], including reduced phosphorylation of actin ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14706699 Escalante et al. 2004]). <br />Microarray analysis lead to the identificationof several genes that fail to be expressed, or are expressed at reduced levels in the ''srfA'' null mutant. Many of these genes are required for spore maturation processes and include: [/gene/DDB_G0288359 dcd3A], [/gene/DDB_G0269108 catB], [/gene/DDB_G0291970 cofB],[/gene/DDB_G0283621 cutA], [/gene/DDB_G0290187 hspH], [/gene/DDB_G0269254 sigJ],[/gene/DDB_G0271922 mcfI], [/gene/DDB_G0292736 pipA], [/gene/DDB_G0277275 poxA], [/gene/DDB_G0275177 sigI], [/gene/DDB_G0277921 sigE],[/gene/DDB_G0289885 sigF], [/gene/DDB_G0290071 sigG], [/gene/DDB_G0282293 rnpA], [/gene/DDB_G0272524 malA], [/gene/DDB_G0293364 sigB], [/gene/DDB_G0277273 phg1b] (sigC),[/gene/DDB_G0267474 sigD], [/gene/DDB_G0289075 spiA], [/gene/DDB_G0280061 sybA],[/gene/DDB_G0286563 sigM], [/gene/DDB_G0273261 sigL], and [/gene/DDB_G0267476 sigK] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14665466 Escalante et al. 2003], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15075287 Escalante et al. 2004]). <br />The MADS-box (for the initials of the first identified members: MCM1, ARG80 from yeast, Deficient from Arabidopsis and SRF from humans) is a in a highly conserved60 amino-acid region that contain a dimerization and a DNA-binding domain.

DDB_G0279797	Pascale Gaudet	[/gene/DDB_G0274597 ctnA], a cell-counting factor in ''Dictyostelium discoideum'', is considered to limit the maximum size of the multicellular structure, because a countin null strain forms a huge fruiting body compared to that of the wild-type ([/ontology/go/0007275/annotation/page/1 multicellular organismal development]). ''countin2'' is highly homologous to countin, sharing 40% identity in amino acid sequence. The countin2 null strain forms a higher number of aggregates, resulting in smaller fruiting bodies compared with those of wild-type cells. Thus, the Countin2 protein is thought to limit the minimum size of the multicellular structure. The size and number of aggregates formed by a mixture of countin null and countin2 null strains were the same as those of the wild-type. These findings demonstrate that a combination of Countin and Countin2 proteins determines the appropriate size of the multicellular structure [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11737154 (Okuwa et al.2001)]Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 22-OCT-2003 PG
DDB_G0281957	Petra Fey	''Ap1g1'' encodes gamma-adaptin, the gamma chain of the ''Dictyostelium'' clathrin adaptor complex 1 (AP-1) ([/ontology/go/0030121/annotation/page/1 AP-1 adaptor complex]). All APs are comprised of two large subunits, one medium size subunit, and one small subunit. ''Dictyostelium'' gamma-adaptin encodes a large subunit (100 kD), which shares 44% identity with the human gamma1-adaptin. Cell fractionation indicated that gamma-adaptin associates with other subunits to form a ''bona fide'' AP-1 complex, further strengthened by th co-immunoprecipitation with mu1 ([/gene/DDB_G0289247 apm1]). GFP-tagged gamma-adaptin colocalized with clathrin in the Golgi apparatus ([/ontology/go/0005794/annotation/page/1 Golgi apparatus]), and pull-down experiments showed that gamma-adaptin binds clathrin ([/ontology/go/0030276/annotation/page/1 clathrin binding]). Studies of the intracellular dynamics demonstrated AP-1-coated structures moving from the Golgi to the periphery, consistent with AP-1's role of cargo transport from the trans-Golgi network to endosomes ([/ontology/go/0006895/annotation/page/1 Golgi to endosome transport]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12802059  (Lefkir et al., 2003)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-SEP-2003 PF

DDB_G0281797	Petra Fey	The oxidative decarboxylation of alpha-keto acids in the catabolism of the branched-chain amino acids (isoleucine, leucine, and valine), is catalyzed by the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex. This mitochondrial enzyme contains 3 catalytic components, E1, E2, and E3. E1 is a heterotetrameric alpha2 ([/gene/DDB_G0286335 bkdA]), beta2 ([/gene/DDB_G0268020 bkdB]) enzyme, with 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase activity ().<br /> E2 is a homo-24-meric dihydrolipoyl transacylase ([/gene/DDB_G0281797 bkdC]) that forms the core of the multienzyme and binds to both E1 and E3 ([/ontology/go/5515/annotation/page/1 protein binding]). The lipoyl group of E2 is reductively 2-methylpropanoylated by E1, and then passes this 2-methylpropanoyl to coenzyme A ([/ontology/go/8415/annotation/page/1 acyltransferase activity]). In addition to the 2-methylpropanoyl group, formed when E1 acts on the oxoacid that corresponds with valine, this enzyme also transfers the 3-methylbutanoyl and S-2-methylbutanoyl groups when E1 acts on the oxoacids corresponding with leucine and isoleucine, respectively.<br />The E3 enzyme ([/gene/DDB_G0291648 lpd]) is adihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase ([/ontology/go/4148/annotation/page/1 dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase activity]) that is shared by three 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase multienzyme complexes.

GBF is highly basic and contains two putative zinc fingers. However, ''in vivo'' GBF function requires only one intact zinc finger[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11397018 (Brown and Firtel 2001)]. Upon starvation, GBF is activated by high cAMP concentration via a G-protein-independent pathway involving [/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1], the high-affinity cAMP receptor that regulates aggregation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7774015 (Schnitzler et al. 1995)]. <br />G boxes are found in the promoters of several postaggregative and cell-type-specific genes, including [/gene/DDB_G0277829 carC], [/gene/DDB_G0276761 cotB], [/gene/DDB_G0277141 cotC], [/gene/DDB_G0290957 cprA], [/gene/DDB_G0279799 cprB], and [/gene/DDB_G0269132 ecmB]([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1321061 Ceccarelli et al. 1992], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2897942 Datta and Firtel 1988], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8482418 Fosnaugh and Loomis 1993], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9126295 Gollop and Kimmel 1997],[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2163344 Haberstroh and Firtel 1990], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1668278 Haberstroh et al. 1991], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2545528 Hjorth et al. 1989], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2159939 1990], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2843819 Pears and Williams 1988], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8065317 Powell-Coffman et al. 1994]).Consistent with these data, analysis of the ''gbfA''-null cell line provided additional evidence that GBF is a key component of the development switch between aggregation and multicellular differentiation as a general inducer of postaggregative and cell-type-specific gene expression ([/ontology/go/0007275/annotation/page/1 multicellular organismal development]). The ''gbfA''-null cells aggregate and express pulse-induced genes normally, but as cells reach the loose mound stage, the postaggregative signaling machinery is not induced, and subsequent morphogenesis is not initiated (reviewed by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10611970 Aubry and Firtel] in 1999).

DDB_G0289329	Pascale Gaudet	Differentiation-inducing factor (DIF)-1 is a chlorinated alkyl phenone released by developing ''Dictyostelium'' cells and that can induce stalk cell differentiation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/183142 (Town et al. 1976)]. The last step in DIF-1 synthesis, the methylation of des-methyl-DIF-1 to form DIF-1, is catalyzed by the product of the ''dmtA'' gene, des-methyl-DIF-1 methyltransferase ([/ontology/go/0008171/annotation/page/1 O-methyltransferase activity]), ([/ontology/go/0008757/annotation/page/1 S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase activity]). The ''dmtA'' mRNA is developmentally regulated, peaking at the first-finger/slug stage in parallel with DIF-1 and methyltransferase enzyme activity ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11163223 Thompson and Kay 2000], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9446571 Kay 1998]). <br />''dmtA'' null mutants can form slugs that are able to produce one prestalk cell type, the pstA cells, and can form mature stalk cells. However, the other major prestalk cell type, the pstO cells, is missing ([/ontology/go/0030154/annotation/page/1 cell differentiation]). Differentiation defects are restored by development on a uniform concentration of DIF-1. It therefore appears that pstO and pstA cells are induced by separate signals and that DIF-1 is the pstO inducer [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11163223 (Thompson and Kay 2000)]. DIF-1 biosynthesis occurs mostly in prespore cells. These results support a model in which prespore cells cross-induce the differentiation of pstO cells by making DIF-1, and that this is one of the regulatory loops that sets the proportion of prespore-to-prestalk cells in the aggregate [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11748133 (Kay and Thompson 2001)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-SEP-2003 PG

Additional members of this family include AAK1 (AP2-associatedkinase), involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11877461 Conner and Schmid 2000]),and BIKe (BMP-induced kinase), which plays a role in bone differentiation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11500515 Kearns et al. 2001]). [/gene/DDB_G0276461 DDB_G0276461] and [/gene/DDB_G0280111 DDB_G0280111] are similar to the kinasedomains of AAK1 and BIKe. The NAK family also includes MPSK (myristoylated and palmitoylated serine/threoninekinase), which is fatty acid acylated ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10364453 Berson et al. 1999]) andmay play a role in TGF-beta signaling ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10947953 Ohta et al. 2000]). The mostclosely related protein to MPSK in ''Dictyostelium discoideum'' is DDB0216373.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 10-MAY-2004 KP
DDB_G0289395	Karen Kestin	In a search for novel receptors similar to the cAR (cAMP receptor) proteins ([/ontology/go/0001646/annotation/page/1 cAMP receptor activity]), [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14732403 Raisley et al. (2004)] identified three crl (cAMP receptor-like) genes: [/gene/DDB_G0280983 crlA], ''crlB'', and [/gene/DDB_G0283619 crlC]. All three of the Crl proteins are predicted to contain aseven transmembrane domain characteristic of G-protein coupled receptors ([/ontology/go/0016021/annotation/page/1 integral to membrane]).<br />The ''crlB'' transcript is found only in post-aggregative cells and peaks after 16 h of starvation. The ''crlB-'' mutant has no detectable phenotype [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14732403 (Raisley et al. 2004)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 24-MAR-2004 KP
DDB_G0291133	Karen Kestin	The wee1 family of tyrosine kinases ([/ontology/go/0004713/annotation/page/1 protein-tyrosine kinase activity]) were originally identified in a screen formutants that undergo mitosis at a reduced cell size in the fission yeast ''Schizosaccharomycespombe'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7262540 Nurse and Thuriaux 1980]). Since then, members ofthe wee1 family have been shown to play an essential role in cell cycle regulation ([/ontology/go/0000074/annotation/page/1 regulation of progression through cell cycle]) in several other organisms, including thebudding yeast ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'', the African clawed frog ''Xenopus laevis'', andseveral metazoans ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14625382 reviewed in Kellogg 2003]).<br />Wee1 phosphorylates a specific tyrosine residue on the mitosis promoting protein Cdk1/Cdc2/Cdc28 ([/gene/DDB_G0272813 cdk1] in ''Dictyostelium''). Phosphorylation of this residue by Wee1 inhibits Cdk1/Cdc2/Cdc28,thereby delaying entry into mitosis from G2. Cdk1/Cdc2/Cdc28 is inactivated by dephosphorylation of thetyrosine residue by the phosphatase Cdc25/Mih1 ([/gene/DDB_G0283617 cdc25] in ''Dictyostelium''), allowingentry into mitosis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14625382 reviewed in Kellogg 2003]).<br />Three uncharacterized putative wee1 family members exist in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome: [/gene/DDB_G0291842 DDB_G0291842], [/gene/DDB_G0277539 DDB_G0277539], and [/gene/DDB_G0291133 DDB_G0291133]. Interestingly, ''Schizosaccharomyces pombe'' and animals also have three wee1 family kinases: wee1, mik1, and myt1.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 21-MAY-2004 KP
DDB_G0289247	Petra Fey	In search for ''Dictyostelium'' clathrin adaptor complexes (APs) cDNAs ''apm1'', [/gene/DDB_G0277901 apm3], and [/gene/DDB_G0276945 apm4], encoding proteins homologous to mammalian medium chain (mu) subunits, have been cloned. All APs are comprised of two large subunits, one medium size subunit, and one small subunit. ''Apm1'' encodes the medium chain of AP-1 ([/ontology/go/0030121/annotation/page/1 AP-1 adaptor complex]), which is known to be associated with clathrin coated vesicles from the trans-Golgi network ([/ontology/go/0030130/annotation/page/1 clathrin coat of trans-Golgi network vesicle]). The ''apm1'' encoded protein (mu1) shares 69% identity with the mouse mu1A, and is very similar in size (49 kD). This, and the presence of conserved residues potentially interacting with tyrosine-based sorting signals indicates that ''apm1'' truly encodes an AP-1 medium chain. Expression levels of ''apm1'' remain constant throughout development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11179674  (de Chassey et al., 2001)].<br />Deletion of ''apm1'' causes defects in growth and spore germination, and a delay in development ([/ontology/go/0007275/annotation/page/1 multicellular organismal development]). Two lysosomal enzymes are secreted as precursors, indicating that lysosomal transport ([/ontology/go/0007041/annotation/page/1 lysosomal transport]) is impaired. Investigation of the endosome membrane marker [/gene/DDB_G0287297 p80] in apm1- cells showed the correct localization, but the size of endosomes appeared smaller and their number was significantly increased compaired to wild-type ([/ontology/go/0007032/annotation/page/1 endosome organization and biogenesis]). This result was confirmed by electron microscopy. Amp1- cells also failed to adjust to hypotonic stress ([/ontology/go/0006971/annotation/page/1 hypotonic response]), and while two markers for the contractile vacuole failed to localize correctly, no contractile vacuole could be identified by electron microscopy. Together with the studies of the AP-1 large subunit [/gene/DDB_G0281957 ap1g1] these data elucidate the functions of the AP-1 vesicular coat protein [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12802059  (Lefkir et al., 2003)].

DDB_G0291037	Pascale Gaudet	DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates ([/ontology/go/0003899/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase activity]). Three distinct zinc-containing RNA polymerases are found in eukaryotic nuclei: [/gene/DDB_G0275759 rpa1] for the ribosomal RNA precursor ([/ontology/go/0006360/annotation/page/1 transcription from RNA polymerase I promoter]), ([/ontology/go/0005736/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase I complex]), [/gene/DDB_G0279193 rpb1] for the mRNA precursor ([/ontology/go/0006366/annotation/page/1 transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter]), ([/ontology/go/0005665/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase II, core complex]), and [/gene/DDB_G0277199 rpc1] for 5S and tRNA genes ([/ontology/go/0006383/annotation/page/1 transcription from RNA polymerase III promoter]), ([/ontology/go/0005666/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase III complex]).<br />RNA polymerase II is composed of 12 subunits: [/gene/DDB_G0279193 rpb1], [/gene/DDB_G0288257 rpb2], [/gene/DDB_G0292244 rpb3], [/gene/DDB_G0282739 rpb4], [/gene/DDB_G0291636 rpb5], [/gene/DDB_G0291037 rpb6], [/gene/DDB_G0284891 rpb7], [/gene/DDB_G0278039 rpb8], [/gene/DDB_G0268306 rpb9], [/gene/DDB_G0272036 rpb10], [/gene/DDB_G0277677 rpb11], and[/gene/DDB_G0283365 rpb12]. Subunits 5, 6, 8, 10, and 12 are common to all threeRNA polymerases (reviewed by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9618449 Hampsey] in 1998). <br />Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 09-APR-2004 PG
DDB_G0289319	Pascale Gaudet	Members of the Myb family of transcription factors are typically composed of two orthree imperfect repeats each of about 50 amino acids. These repeats fold into a variant ofthe helix-turn-helix motif and bind DNA ([/ontology/go/0003677/annotation/page/1 DNA binding]). The Myb motif has been well conserved during evolution (see [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10331990 Guo et al. 1999] and references therein).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 07-MAY-2004 PG
DDB_G0289325	Petra Fey	 Succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS) is an enzyme in the [/ontology/go/0006099/annotation/page/1 tricarboxylic acid cycle] that catalyzes the formation of succinyl-CoA from succinate with the concomitant hydrolysis of NTP to NDP and phosphate. There are two forms of the enzyme, using either ATP or GTP. The [/gene/DDB_G0289325 scsA] gene encodes the succinyl-CoA synthetase alpha subunit. In eukaryotes one alpha and one beta subunit are thought to form a heterodimer. Anschutzt ''et al.'' determined that in crude [/ontology/go/0016020/annotation/page/1 membrane] extracts ScsA could be phosphorylated by ATP and GTP, but the purified enzyme showed high specificity for GTP ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8448193  Anschutz et al., 1993]). <br />Only one alpha subunit has been identified in ''Dictyostelium'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7771809  Birney and Klein, 1995]). However, two beta subunits are present in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome; [/gene/DDB_G0274449 scsB] is the ortholog of GDP-forming succinyl-CoA ligase beta subunits () and [/gene/DDB_G0271842 scsC] is highly similar to known ADP-forming succinyl-CoA ligase beta subunits ().Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 27-JAN-2005 PF
DDB_G0291081	Karen Kestin	The [/gene/DDB_G0291081 pefA] and [/gene/DDB_G0293530 pefB] genes were identified as homologs of mammalian ALG-2 (<u>a</u>poptosis-<u>l</u>inked <u>g</u>ene 2), which is involved in programmed cell death, as its name suggests. The pefA and pefB proteins eachcontain five calcium-binding ([/ontology/go/0005509/annotation/page/1 calcium ion binding]) EF hand motifs ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11481037 Ohkouchi et al.2001], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11927596 Aubry et al. 2002]).<br />Expression of ''pefA'' mRNA is developmentally regulated, however, two separate Northern blot experiments show differentpatterns of expression. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11481037  Ohkouchi and colleagues (2001)] show that ''pefA'' expressionis low during growth and gradually increases through the developmental program, whereas [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11927596 Aubry et al.(2002)] report a peak in ''pefA'' expression at 4 hours followed by a rapid decline. PefA has been shown tolocalize intracellularly to the cytoplasm ([/ontology/go/0005737/annotation/page/1 cytoplasm]) and, in the presence of calcium, to the membrane fraction ([/ontology/go/0005624/annotation/page/1 membrane fraction]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11481037 Ohkouchi et al. 2001], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11927596 Aubry et al.2002]). Additionally, in situ hybridization analysis of ''pefA'' shows expression in the posterior presporeregion ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11481037 Ohkouchi et al. 2001]).<br />In surface plasmon resonance experiments, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11927596 Aubry and colleagues (2002)] demonstrate thatPefA is capable of dimerizing with itself ([/ontology/go/0042803/annotation/page/1 protein homodimerization activity]), PefB ([/ontology/go/0046982/annotation/page/1 protein heterodimerization activity]), and with murine Alix (ALG-2 interacting protein X, homolog of ''Dictyostelium'' [/gene/DDB_G0275451 alxA]). PefB, on the other hand, heterodimerizes ([/ontology/go/0046982/annotation/page/1 protein heterodimerization activity]) with PefA but fails to dimerize with murineAlix. Additionally, they show that null mutants of both '' pefA'' and ''pefB'' and double mutants ''pefA-''/''pefB-'' have no detectable developmental phenotype.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 08-SEP-2004 KP
DDB_G0292956	Karen Kestin	Initiation of protein translation in eukaryotes is regulated by phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotictranslation initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha). During periods of amino acid starvation, eIF2alpha is inactivated viaphosphorylation by the serine/threonine kinase ([/ontology/go/0004674/annotation/page/1 protein serine/threonine kinase activity]) GCN2 (general control nonderepressible), also known asPEK (pancreatic eukaryotic translation initiation factor kinase). The PEK family of protein kinases is highly conservedfrom yeast to humans, however, the effect on translation in metazoans is global whereas GCN2 in yeast acts to inhibittranslation of specific species of mRNA ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7855893  reviewed in Wek 1994]).<br />In ''Dictyostelium'', two members of the PEK family of protein kinases have been identified: [/gene/DDB_G0272837 ifkA] and[/gene/DDB_G0276829 ifkB].

DDB_G0292994	Karen Kestin	The net reaction of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, which then enters the tricarboxylic acidcycle (TCA). The complex contains three enzymes, E1, E2, and E3. E1 is a pyruvate dehydrogenase () that consists ofan alpha subunit [/gene/DDB_G0292994 pdhA] and a beta subunit [/gene/DDB_G0276417 pdhB]. E2 ([/gene/DDB_G0277847 pdhC]) forms the core of thecomplex and possesses dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase activity ([/ontology/go/0004742/annotation/page/1 dihydrolipoyllysine-residue acetyltransferase activity]). The E3 enzyme [/gene/DDB_G0291648 lpd] is adihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase ([/ontology/go/0004148/annotation/page/1 dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase activity]) that is shared by three 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes and the glycine cleavage system. In addition, the pyruvatedehydrogenase complex contains component X ([/gene/DDB_G0271564 pdhX]) that binds E3 ([/ontology/go/0005515/annotation/page/1 protein binding]) and has an apparent structural rolein the complex (reviewed in [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9399911 Aral et al. 1997]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 01-DEC-2004 KP
DDB_G0292354	Karen Kestin	Members of the casein kinase I (CK1) family ([/ontology/go/0004681/annotation/page/1 casein kinase I activity]) of serine/threonine kinases have been implicated in manycellular processes. Casein kinases have been shown to phosphorylate the 14-3-3 ([/gene/DDB_G0269138 fttB]) protein inmammals, play a role in Wnt signaling in ''Xenopus laevis'' and ''Caenorhabditis elegans'', and maintaincircadian rhythms in ''Drosophila melanogaster''. Additionally, CK1 plays a role in DNA repair ([/ontology/go/0006281/annotation/page/1 DNA repair])in ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' and ''Schizosaccharomyces pombe'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10880352 Moreno-Bueno et al. 2000]).<br />Two casein kinase I family members have been identified in ''Dictyostelium discoideum'', [/gene/DDB_G0273059 cak1] and''DDB0216336''. Cak1 is highly similar to CK1s in yeast and in metazoans. DDB0216336 is a putative casein kinase Ithat is highly similar to the CK1 subfamily tau-tubulin kinase (TTBK) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12471243 Manning etal. 2002]). The Cak1 protein has been shown to phosphorylate casein when it is expressed in ''E.coli'' cells, and localizes to both the cytoplasm ([/ontology/go/0005737/annotation/page/1 cytoplasm]) and the nucleus ([/ontology/go/0005634/annotation/page/1 nucleus]) inimmunofluorescence assays. Null mutations and overexpression of a dominant-negative form of Cak1 fail to produce viable cells, indicating that this protein may be essential for growth. Overexpression of wild-type Cak1 results in decreased sensitivity to the DNA-damaging agent hydroxyurea; this suggests a role for Cak1 in DNA repair ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10880352 Moreno-Bueno et al. 2000]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 05-MAY-2004 KP

The Myb motif has been well conserved during evolution (see [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10331990 Guo et al. 1999] and references therein).<br />The putative DNA-binding domain of ''Dictyostelium mybA'' is as closely related to vertebrate c-Myb as is ''Drosophila'' Myb (65% identity), whereas the known Myb-related proteins of plants and yeast are more distantly related. The conserved domain of ''Dictyostelium'' MybA is capable of binding to the same DNA sequence as the vertebrate and ''Drosophila'' Myb proteins. The remainder of the deduced amino acid sequence of ''Dictyostelium'' MybA shows no homology to the divergent domains of the known animal, plant and yeast Myb-related proteins. Evolutionary analysis implies that the duplications that generated the repeats of the Myb DNA-binding domain began prior to the divergence of animals, plants, cellular slime molds and yeast [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1549373 (Stober-Grasser et al. 1992)]<br />In electrophoretic shift assays, MybA binds specifically to a sequence from the [/gene/DDB_G0269112 celB] promoter containing the Myb consensus binding site TAACTGA ([/ontology/go/0003677/annotation/page/1 DNA binding]).

DDB_G0286335	Petra Fey	The oxidative decarboxylation of alpha-keto acids in the catabolism of the branched-chain amino acids (isoleucine, leucine, and valine), is catalyzed by the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex. This mitochondrial enzyme contains 3 catalytic components, E1, E2, and E3. E1 is a heterotetrameric alpha2 ([/gene/DDB_G0286335 bkdA]), beta2 ([/gene/DDB_G0268020 bkdB]) enzyme, with 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase activity ().<br /> E2 is a homo-24-meric dihydrolipoyl transacylase ([/gene/DDB_G0281797 bkdC]) that forms the core of the multienzyme and binds to both E1 and E3 ([/ontology/go/5515/annotation/page/1 protein binding]). The lipoyl group of E2 is reductively 2-methylpropanoylated by E1, and then passes this 2-methylpropanoyl to coenzyme A ([/ontology/go/8415/annotation/page/1 acyltransferase activity]). In addition to the 2-methylpropanoyl group, formed when E1 acts on the oxoacid that corresponds with valine, this enzyme also transfers the 3-methylbutanoyl and S-2-methylbutanoyl groups when E1 acts on the oxoacids corresponding with leucine and isoleucine, respectively.<br />The E3 enzyme ([/gene/DDB_G0291648 lpd]) is adihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase ([/ontology/go/4148/annotation/page/1 dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase activity]) that is shared by three 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase multienzyme complexes.

DDB_G0287291	Petra Fey	The ''abpD'' gene was identified in a search for novel members of the alpha-actinin superfamily. The interaptin protein has an approximate molecular weight of 200 kD and consists of three distinct domains: the N-terminal actin binding domain ([/ontology/go/0003779/annotation/page/1 actin binding]), a central coiled-coil rod domain, and a C-terminal membrane binding domain. It has been shown that interaptin associates with the nuclear envelope and the ER ([/ontology/go/0042175/annotation/page/1 nuclear envelope-endoplasmic reticulum network]) via the membrane binding domain. The ''abpD'' transcript and protein are developmentally and cAMP-regulated. In the abpD- mutant development ([/ontology/go/0007275/annotation/page/1 multicellular organismal development]) is delayed and cell agglutination ([/ontology/go/0016337/annotation/page/1 cell-cell adhesion]) is slighly impaired [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9700162  (Rivero et al., 1998)]. When abpD-null cells were investigated on soil substrate (under conditions closer to natural ones), more severe developmental defects were found. The fruiting body size and shape is heterogenious and slugs have enlargements all over the slug body and release a high amount of slime sheath. Spore viability ([/ontology/go/0009847/annotation/page/1 spore germination]) was also shown to be severely reduced [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10704840  (Ponte et al., 2000)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-SEP-2003 PF

Additional members of this family include AAK1 (AP2-associatedkinase), involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11877461 Conner and Schmid 2000]),and BIKe (BMP-induced kinase), which plays a role in bone differentiation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11500515 Kearns et al. 2001]). DDB0229347 and [/gene/DDB_G0280111 DDB_G0280111] are similar to the kinasedomains of AAK1 and BIKe. The NAK family also includes MPSK (myristoylated and palmitoylated serine/threoninekinase), which is fatty acid acylated ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10364453 Berson et al. 1999]) andmay play a role in TGF-beta signaling ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10947953 Ohta et al. 2000]).

Similarly, the [/gene/DDB_G0270544 gdt6]protein lacks this essential residue found in [/gene/DDB_G0270666 gdt2], [/gene/DDB_G0285891 gdt3], [/gene/DDB_G0270550 gdt4], and [/gene/DDB_G0270668 gdt8] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15236669 Chibalina et al. 2004]).<br />In a search for mutants resistant to a phospholipase D (PLD) inhibitor, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15236669 Chibalina et al.2004] identified ''gdt2''. Similar to the [/gene/DDB_G0278723 gdt1] mutant, ''gdt2'' null cells express high levels of discoidinand aggregate prematurely. However, unlike Gdt1, Gdt2 does not appear to be in the PKA pathway; treatment of ''gdt2-''cells with a PKA inhibitor represses discoidin expression, bypassing the discoidin overexpression phenotype. Also in contrastto ''gdt1'' is the ''gdt2'' expression profile: the ''gdt2'' transcript can be detected at constant levels at all stages of development([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15236669 Chibalina et al. 2004]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 10-SEP-2004 KP
DDB_G0276767	Pascale Gaudet	Phospholipase B (PLB) catalyzes the degradation of phosphatidylcholine to glycerophosphocholine. [/ontology/go/0004622/annotation/page/1 lysophospholipase activity] has been detected in ''Dictyostelium'' in 1970 by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5528230 Ferber and colleagues]. The gene encoding this activity was described in 2004 by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15193148 Morgan et al.] PLB does not share any similarity with other known phospholipase B proteins. Remarkably, proteins with significant similarity to ''Dictyostelium'' PLB are found in mammals, ''C. elegans'', and ''Drosophila''. This gene therefore appear to make up a new gene family that have phospholipase B activity. In addition to phosphatidylcholine, PLB also hydrolyses phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol, indicating that it plays roles in [/ontology/go/0009395/annotation/page/1 phospholipid catabolic process], [/ontology/go/0046338/annotation/page/1 phosphatidylethanolamine catabolic process], and [/ontology/go/0046488/annotation/page/1 phosphatidylinositol metabolic process].

DDB_G0269132	Pascale Gaudet	The ''ecmB'' gene encodes an extracellular matrix protein that is a structural component of the stalk tube([/ontology/go/0005201/annotation/page/1 extracellular matrix structural constituent]), ([/ontology/go/0030198/annotation/page/1 extracellular matrix organization and biogenesis]), ([/ontology/go/0005578/annotation/page/1 proteinaceous extracellular matrix]) . [/gene/DDB_G0277853 ecmA], ''ecmB'', and [/gene/DDB_G0294473 staA] were isolated as prestalk-specific, DIF-inducible genes. ''ecmB'' null cells undergo apparently normal development, suggesting a functional redundancy between [/gene/DDB_G0277853 ecmA] and ''ecmB'' [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8200481 (Morrison et al. 1994)]. <br />Differential expression of ''ecmA'' and ''ecmB'' in the anterior zone has led to the identification of several different prestalk cell types: the pstA cells, located at the anterior-most region of the prestalk zone and characterized by high expression of the ''ecmA'' gene directed by the proximal part of its promoter (''ecmA'' promoter), the pstAB cells, forming a cone-shaped area of the prestalk zone that occupies a core among the pstA region in which cells express both the ecmA and ecmB genes, and the pstO cells, located posterior to the pstA zone and characterized by low expression of the ''ecmA'' gene directed by the distal part of its promoter (ecmO promoter) (reviewed by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8016318 Williams and Morrison] in 1994).

Biochemical properties of the SgkA and SgkB proteins demonstrate that they correspond to the human Sphk1 and Sphk2, respectively. SgkA is localized to the [/ontology/go/0005829/annotation/page/1 cytosol], the [/ontology/go/0005634/annotation/page/1 nucleus], and in some pseudopodia ([/ontology/go/0031143/annotation/page/1 pseudopodium]). Single and double knock outs showed that sphingosine kinase is involved in [/ontology/go/0008284/annotation/page/1 positive regulation of cell proliferation] and in resistance to the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15643073 Min et al., 2004]).

WRKY proteins have specific [/ontology/go/0003677/annotation/page/1 DNA binding] activity towards the W-box, TTGAC(C/T).

The ''kinX'' transcript is weakly detected at constant levels throughout development, whereas ''kinY''is expressed at low levels during growth, increasing throughout development with a peak during culmination.Additionally, ''kinY'' is enriched in the prespore cells of slugs ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7857991 Wetterauer et al.1995], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10899639 Wetterauer 2000]).<br />Seven putative LISK proteins exist in the ''Dictyostelium'' proteome: [/gene/DDB_G0275165 DDB_G0275165], [/gene/DDB_G0271538 DDB_G0271538], [/gene/DDB_G0269298 gefX], [/gene/DDB_G0281745 DDB_G0281745], [/gene/DDB_G0280461 DDB_G0280461], [/gene/DDB_G0271402 DDB_G0271402], [/gene/DDB_G0289859 kxcA].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 04-OCT-2004 KP
DDB_G0291842	Karen Kestin	The wee1 family of tyrosine kinases ([/ontology/go/0004713/annotation/page/1 protein-tyrosine kinase activity]) were originally identified in a screen formutants that undergo mitosis at a reduced cell size in the fission yeast ''Schizosaccharomycespombe'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7262540 Nurse and Thuriaux 1980]). Since then, members ofthe wee1 family have been shown to play an essential role in cell cycle regulation ([/ontology/go/0000074/annotation/page/1 regulation of progression through cell cycle]) in several other organisms, including thebudding yeast ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'', the African clawed frog ''Xenopus laevis'', andseveral metazoans ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14625382 reviewed in Kellogg 2003]).<br />Wee1 phosphorylates a specific tyrosine residue on the mitosis promoting protein Cdk1/Cdc2/Cdc28 ([/gene/DDB_G0272813 cdk1] in ''Dictyostelium''). Phosphorylation of this residue by Wee1 inhibits Cdk1/Cdc2/Cdc28,thereby delaying entry into mitosis from G2. Cdk1/Cdc2/Cdc28 is inactivated by dephosphorylation of thetyrosine residue by the phosphatase Cdc25/Mih1 ([/gene/DDB_G0283617 cdc25] in ''Dictyostelium''), allowingentry into mitosis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14625382 reviewed in Kellogg 2003]).<br />Three uncharacterized putative wee1 family members exist in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome: [/gene/DDB_G0291842 DDB_G0291842], [/gene/DDB_G0277539 DDB_G0277539], and [/gene/DDB_G0291133 DDB_G0291133]. Interestingly, ''Schizosaccharomyces pombe'' and animals also have three wee1 family kinases: wee1, mik1, and myt1.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 21-MAY-2004 KP
DDB_G0285427	Petra Fey	The ''mkcA'' gene was, along with [/gene/DDB_G0284331 regA], discovered in a screen for genetic suppressors of the [/gene/DDB_G0286119 tagB] mutation. Disruption of ''mkcA'' results in partial suppression of the block to spore formation following the loss of the prestalk gene ''tagB''. Expression of prestalk marker genes [/gene/DDB_G0277853 ecmA] and [/gene/DDB_G0269132 ecmB] in ''mkcA'' null cells is strongly reduced, while the prespore marker [/gene/DDB_G0276761 cotB] is not affected. ''mkcA'' encodes a putative serine/threonine kinase ([/ontology/go/0004674/annotation/page/1 protein serine/threonine kinase activity]) that belongs to the STE20/PAKA family, mitogen-activated protein kinases involved in signalling. Genetic interaction with the ''tagB'' intercellular signalling defects suggest that ''mkcA'' is part of the pathway that regulates cell differentiation ([/ontology/go/0045595/annotation/page/1 regulation of cell differentiation]) in ''Dictyostelium'' [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8986798  (Shaulsky et al., 1996)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 18-OCT-2004 PF

The [/gene/DDB_G0291834 cpiA](cystatin A1) protein is expressed throughout development, and is present in both soluble ([/ontology/go/0005625/annotation/page/1 soluble fraction]) and vesicular ([/ontology/go/0042598/annotation/page/1 vesicular fraction]) cell fractions. Expression of [/gene/DDB_G0280439 cpiB] (cystatin A2) is developmentally regulated; the protein is firstdetected at the aggregation stage and peaks during culmination. In a cell fractionation assay, the CpiB protein is detected solelyin the soluble fraction ([/ontology/go/0005625/annotation/page/1 soluble fraction]). Both CpiA and CpiB are capable of inhibiting cysteine proteases in vitro ([/ontology/go/0004869/annotation/page/1 cysteine protease inhibitor activity]),([/ontology/go/0006508/annotation/page/1 proteolysis]).

The protein is localized to the [/ontology/go/0005737/annotation/page/1 cytoplasm]. Null mutant in ''lrrA'' arrest at the mound stage and do not form a tip, indicating that they have defects in [/ontology/go/0031154/annotation/page/1 culmination during sorocarp development].

DDB_G0272799	Petra Fey	The ''icmA'' gene encodes the conserved isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase in ''Dictyostelium''. The protein was shown to have [/ontology/go/0004671/annotation/page/1 protein-S-isoprenylcysteine O-methyltransferase activity]. The ''icmA''-null mutant shows defects in early development, such as no cell polarization ([/ontology/go/0030010/annotation/page/1 establishment of cell polarity]) or streaming, aberrant cAMP wave formation, and in some cases loose mound formation that may proceed to form aberrant fruiting bodies ([/ontology/go/0060176/annotation/page/1 regulation of aggregation involved in sorocarp development]). In the mutant, the starvation-induced expression of the cAMP receptor [/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1] is delayed, also reflected in the fact that mutant membranes bind only 34% of the CAMP that wild-type membranes bind. However, in pulsed mutant cells the cAMP relay response is 3 times larger than in wild type. In addition, Ras GTPase ([/gene/DDB_G0293434 rasG]) has been shown to be methylated and in the ''icmA''-null mutant RasG, as well as CRAC ([/gene/DDB_G0285161 dagA]) are mislocalized in cAMP-pulsed cells. In sum, these data show that isoprenylcysteine methylation is required for signalling in response to cAMP ([/ontology/go/0008277/annotation/page/1 regulation of G-protein coupled receptor protein signaling pathway]) and development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17699599 Chen et al. 2007)].

DDB_G0285343	Pascale Gaudet	Transcription factor IIA (TFIIA) is one of several factors that form part of a transcription preinitiation complex along with [/gene/DDB_G0288257 rpb2], the TATA-box-binding protein (TBP, encoded by the [/gene/DDB_G0275617 tbpA] gene)and TBP-associated factors (TAFs) on the TATA-box sequence upstream of the initiation start site. TFIIA binds to TBP to stabilise TBP binding to the TATA element. In yeast, TFIIA is dispensable for accurate initiation of transcription but plays an important role in transcriptional activation, functioning as either an antirepressor or a coactivator. <br /> Human TFIIA and Drosophila TFIIA are composed of three subunits. The two larger subunits (alpha and beta) are encoded by the same gene and appear to be posttranslationally modified forms of a precursor protein. In yeast, two genes TOA1 and TOA2 are homologs of the large and the small subunits, respectively (reviewed by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9618449 Hampsey] in 1998). In ''Dictyostelium'', [/gene/DDB_G0290327 gtf2a1] encodes the large (alpha/beta) subunits and [/gene/DDB_G0285343 gtf2a2] encodes the small (gamma) subunit.

DDB_G0291039	Robert Dodson	The motor domain in the kinesin encoded by ''kif11'' is at the N-terminus and belongs to the CENP-E family of domains of kinetochore-associated proteins that align chromosomes during mitosis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14641909  (Kollmar and Glockner 2003)]. Disruption of the ''kif11'' showed that Kif11 is not required for mitotic spindle assembly, cell growth or development. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18430243  (Nag et al. 2008)]. Microtubule distributions appear normal in ''kif11'' null cells but the effects of expression of the truncated 380-kDa form of dynein were less pronounced in ''kif11'' cells than in wild type cells suggesting that dynein and Kif11 cooperate to some extent in organizing the radial interphase microtubule distribution. Imaging of GFP-labeled Kif11 expressing cells indicates that Kif11 is a plus-end directed motor that accumulates at microtubule plus ends.

DDB_G0282835	Pascale Gaudet	The MADS-box (for the initials of the first identified members: MCM1, ARG80 from yeast, Deficient from Arabidopsis and SRF from humans) is a in a highly conserved60 amino-acid region that contain a dimerization and a DNA-binding domain ([/ontology/go/0003700/annotation/page/1 transcription factor activity]), ([/ontology/go/0006355/annotation/page/1 regulation of transcription, DNA-dependent]). The serum response factor (SRF) is a DNA-binding proteininvolved in the transcriptional activation ofgenes in response to serum in cultured mammalian cells (see [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9729488 Escalante and Sastre 1998] and references therein).There are 4 predicted proteins that contain a MADS box in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome: [/gene/DDB_G0281387 srfA], [/gene/DDB_G0282835 srfB], [/gene/DDB_G0268920 srfC], and [/gene/DDB_G0283483 srfD].<br />''srfB'' is expressed in vegetative cells as well as during late aggregation (6-12h). Its promoter has three different transcription start sites active in different cell types. Null mutants of ''srfB'' have a number of different phenotypes: accelerated aggregation, abolished streaming, decreased growth rate, aberrant cytokinesis, and increased pinocytosis. The developmental defects can be rescued by providing cAMP pulses, indicating that at last some of the defects observed are due to aberrant cAMP signaling ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18339368 Galardi-Castilla et al. 2008]).

DDB_G0278077	Pascale Gaudet	The CRTF protein was isolated from nuclear extracts ([/ontology/go/0005634/annotation/page/1 nucleus]) by its ability to bind the [/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1] promoter. The deduced CRTFprotein is ~100 kDa with a C-terminal, zinc finger-likemotif required for DNA binding ([/ontology/go/0042156/annotation/page/1 zinc-mediated transcriptional activator activity]). ''crtf''-null strains fail to developunder standard conditions ([/ontology/go/0007275/annotation/page/1 multicellular organismal development]) or to exhibit induced expressionof ''carA'' or other cAMP-regulated genes ([/ontology/go/0045941/annotation/page/1 positive regulation of transcription]). Furthermore,''crtf''-nulls fail to sporulate ([/ontology/go/0030435/annotation/page/1 sporulation]), even under conditions thatbypass the dependence on early cAMP signaling pathways.Early developmental events of ''crtf''-null strainscan be rescued with exogenous cAMP treatment,constitutive expression of CAR1 or co-development withwild-type cells; however, these treatments are insufficientto promote sporulation. This suggests a cell-autonomousrole for CRTF during late development that is separatefrom its capacity to control ''carA'' expression ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11493573 Mu et al. 2001]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 28-MAY-2004 PG

DDB_G0282817	Petra Fey	PAT2 is a ''Dictyostelium'' P-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase that is very similar to plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-transporting ATPases (proton pumps) ([/ontology/go/0015992/annotation/page/1 proton transport]) of plants and fungi. The ''patB'' gene is expressed at low levels in cells growing at neutral pH, but it is up-regulated significantly when cells are shifted to an acidic medium. Immunofluorescence experiments showed PAT2 localization at the plasma [/ontology/go/0016020/annotation/page/1 membrane]. ''patB''-null cells grew and developed normally at neutral pH, but where unable to grow at pH 5. At pH 6.8, wild-type and knock-out cells exhibited similar levels of vanadate-sensitive [/ontology/go/0016887/annotation/page/1 ATPase activity], but when cells were transferred to pH 5 the activity increased rapidly in wild-type, but not in the mutant. These results suggest that PAT2 is an acid-inducible P-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase that is essential for survival of ''Dictyostelium'' amoebae in acidic medium [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9421912  (Coukell et al. 1997)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 15-JUL-2005 PF
DDB_G0289179	Petra Fey	''Dictyostelium'' thymidine kinase 1 (TK1), encoded by the ''thyB'' gene, has been isolated by its [/ontology/go/0005516/annotation/page/1 calmodulin binding] activity. The 25.5 kDa protein contains a CaM binding domain and an [/ontology/go/0005524/annotation/page/1 ATP binding] domain, and is very similar to mammalian thymidine kinases, also evident in the fact that human TK1 antibodies recognize the ''Dictyostelium'' protein. Calmodulin ([/gene/DDB_G0279407 calA]) binding of TK1 has been shown to be Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent. Both proteins, TK1 and calmodulin, are expressed strongest in vegetative, proliferating cells, after which expression declines.

DDB_G0292850	Pascale Gaudet	In mammalian cells, phosducin binds to G proteins and modulate their activity. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that there are three groups of phodsucin proteins. ''Dictyostelium'', like mammalian cells and ''Drosophila'', has one member from each group: [/gene/DDB_G0292850 phlp1], [/gene/DDB_G0285433 phlp2], and [/gene/DDB_G0293848 phlp3]. Phosducins consist of an N-terminal domain containing three helices which binds the alpha subunit of G proteins, and a C-terminal domain which bears similarity to thioredoxin and binds to the beta/gamma subunit of G proteins. <br />Phlp1 contains all the conserved residues necessary for Galpha and Gbeta/gamma binding. Disruption of the ''phlp1'' gene causes numerous defects. The mutant grows slowly both on bacteria and in axenic medium. The mutant fails to aggregate ([/ontology/go/0031152/annotation/page/1 aggregation involved in sorocarp development]), and that defect is not rescued with mixing with wild-type cells or with exogenous cAMP. The mutant also has defects in [/ontology/go/0043327/annotation/page/1 chemotaxis to cAMP] and [/ontology/go/0043326/annotation/page/1 chemotaxis to folate]. The mutant has several defects in cAMP signaling: the number of high affinity cAMP binding sites on the cell membranes is significantly reduced, and the mutant fails to produce cAMP or cGMP following cAMP stimulus ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14517243 Blaauw et al. 2003]). <br />The phenotype of ''phlp1'' null cells is very similar to that of Gbeta ([/gene/DDB_G0277143 gpbA]) null cells. In support of a link between G proteins and Phlp1, Gbeta and Ggamma are mislocalized in ''phlp1''- cells: there are found in the cytosol rather than on the cell surface. Also, Gbeta and Ggamma are present as monomers rather than associated together. Finally, Ggamma is not prenylated, neither in ''phlp1''- nor in ''gpaB''- cells. This data, together with evidence obtained in other systems, is consistent with a model where Phlp1 plays a role in the heterodimerization of Gbeta and Ggamma, which is presumed to be necessary for prenylation of Ggamma and its association with plasma membranes ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16135826 Knol et al. 2005]).

In situ hybridization analysis of '' pefB'' shows expression inthe anterior tip of the prestalk region ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11481037 Ohkouchi et al. 2001]).<br />In surface plasmon resonance experiments, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11927596 Aubry and colleagues (2002)] demonstrate thatPefA is capable of dimerizing with itself ([/ontology/go/0042803/annotation/page/1 protein homodimerization activity]), PefB ([/ontology/go/0046982/annotation/page/1 protein heterodimerization activity]), and with murine Alix (ALG-2 interacting protein X, homolog of ''Dictyostelium'' [/gene/DDB_G0275451 alxA]). PefB, on the other hand, heterodimerizes ([/ontology/go/0046982/annotation/page/1 protein heterodimerization activity]) with PefA but fails to dimerize with murineAlix. Additionally, they show that null mutants of both '' pefA'' and ''pefB'' and double mutants ''pefA-''/''pefB-'' have no detectable developmental phenotype.<br />[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15950752 Lardy et al. 2005] recently found that pefB acts as a supressor in mutant strains of the NADPH oxidase large subunits [/gene/DDB_G0289653 noxA] and [/gene/DDB_G0287101 noxB], and the small subunit [/gene/DDB_G0267460 cybA].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 08-SEP-2004 KP

DDB_G0276759	Pascale Gaudet	The ''cbpA'' gene encodes a [/ontology/go/0005509/annotation/page/1 calcium ion binding] protein, CBP1 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7729526 Coukell et al. 2000]). CBP1 associates with the [/ontology/go/0015629/annotation/page/1 actin cytoskeleton] during development. ''cbpA''-null cells grow normally, but exhibits delayed aggregation when developed in submerged conditions. This defect in aggregation appears to be related to a general reduction in [/ontology/go/0006928/annotation/page/1 cell motility] rather than to defect in the cAMP signaling cascade. Together, these results suggest that CBP1 might function to help regulate the reorganization of the ''Dictyostelium'' actin cytoskeleton during aggregation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10896781 Dharamsi et al. 2000]).<br />CBP1 has been shown to interact with two other calcium-binding proteins, encoded by [/gene/DDB_G0283153 cbpD1] and [/gene/DDB_G0283083 cbpD2] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10771103 Dorywalskal et al. 2000]).

Through micrococcal nuclease digestion, they showed that a lysine-rich proteinfunctions as an H1 histone to bring the two DNA strands together at their exit point from the nucleosome. HistoneH1 was later cloned by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7867938 Hauser and colleagues (1995)], who showed throughSouthern blot analysis that H1 exists in a single copy in the ''Dicytostelium'' genome. Their protein sequenceanalysis revealed the presence of the globular domain found higher eukaryotes and a putative cdc2 kinasephosphorylation site. They did not find, however, a nucleotide binding loop or a consensus cAMP-dependent phosphorylationsite. This is consistent with the findings of [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1321059 Heads et al.

DDB_G0281827	Pascale Gaudet	The ''dwwA'' gene is required for [/ontology/go/0000910/annotation/page/1 cytokinesis] of ''Dictyostelium'' cells on solid surfaces. Its product, DwwA, contains two WW domains, an IQ motif, a C2 domain and a proline-rich region. DwwA is localized to the [/ontology/go/0005938/annotation/page/1 cell cortex] and the [/ontology/go/0005634/annotation/page/1 nucleus]; the N-terminal half of the protein, which contains the C2 domain, is required for the cortical localization of DWWA. ''dwwA''-null cells have higher levels of F-actin around the periphery of the ventral surface of the cell ([/ontology/go/0007015/annotation/page/1 actin filament organization]). The IQ motif of DwwA binds [/gene/DDB_G0279407 calA] ''in vitro'' ([/ontology/go/0005516/annotation/page/1 calmodulin binding]). DwwA has been proposed to function as an adaptor protein, participating in cytokinesis by mediating the interaction of Ca(2+)/calmodulin with the actin cytoskeleton ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14595117 Nagasaki and Uyeda 2003]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 21-NOV-2003 PG
DDB_G0293848	Pascale Gaudet	In mammalian cells, phosducin binds to G proteins and modulate their activity. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that there are three groups of phodsucin proteins.

Phosducins consist of an N-terminal domain containing three helices which binds the alpha subunit of G proteins, and a C-terminal domain which bears similarity to thioredoxin and binds to the beta/gamma subunit of G proteins. <br />Phlp3 completely lacks the helix involved in G beta/gamma binding.

DDB_G0284791	Petra Fey	''Dictyostelium cpnC'' belongs to the highly conserved copines, a family of ubiquitious Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipid-binding ([/ontology/go/0005544/annotation/page/1 calcium-dependent phospholipid binding]) proteins. In their N-terminal half, copines contain two Ca(2+)- and phospholipid-binding domains (C2 domains) present in such proteins as phospholipase C and protein kinase C. Much of the C-terminal half consists of a von Willebrand Factor type A domain (VWFA) typically found in the extracellular portions of membrane proteins like integrins. Thus copines represent a fusion of intracellular (C2) and extracellular (VWFA) domains. However, there are no signal sequence or hydrophobic transmembrane sequences in the predicted proteins suggesting copines are intracellular proteins. Copines are thought to be involved in membrane trafficking. It is of particular interest that copines, first found in the highly phagocytic protozoan ''Paramecium'' and then isolated from mammalian spleen and liver, seem to be abundant in cells and organs that are, or contain, phagocytes. In this context it comes as no surprise that phagocytic ''Dictyostelium'' has a total of six copine genes[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16343335  (Damer et al. 2005)]. The widespread distribution of copines from protozoans to mammals and their high similarity suggest they play important role(s) in eukaryotic biology.

DDB_G0289555	Karen Kestin	The ''arkA'' gene was identified in a screen for suppressors of the protein phosphatase [/gene/DDB_G0276155 spnA]mutant ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14597204 Aubry et al. 2003]). ArkA contains several functionaldomains, including a protein kinase domain ([/ontology/go/0004672/annotation/page/1 protein kinase activity]) that is classified in the tyrosine kinase-like (TKL)group of protein kinases. The ''arkA'' transcript is developmentally regulated such that two peaks inexpression are detected by Northern blot at 8 hours and 15 hours after starvation. Spatial expression of thetranscript is highly enriched in the prestalk region in the slug and in the stalk and the tip of the fruitingbody. Subcellular localization is detected in the cortex, most likely associated with the cytoskeleton ([/ontology/go/0030863/annotation/page/1 cortical cytoskeleton]).<br />Disruption of the ''arkA'' gene results in abnormal fruiting bodies, whereas overexpression results in severemorphological defects ([/ontology/go/0007275/annotation/page/1 multicellular organismal development]). Expression levels of developmental markers [/gene/DDB_G0280531 lagC], [/gene/DDB_G0277853 ecmA],and [/gene/DDB_G0277141 cotC] are not affected in ''arkA-'' cells, however, the spore-specific [/gene/DDB_G0289075 spiA] transcript is elevated in comparison to wild-type.

However, there are no signal sequence or hydrophobic transmembrane sequences in the predicted proteins suggesting copines are intracellular proteins. Copines are thought to be involved in membrane trafficking. It is of particular interest that copines, first found in the highly phagocytic protozoan ''Paramecium'' and then isolated from mammalian spleen and liver, seem to be abundant in cells and organs that are, or contain, phagocytes. In this context it comes as no surprise that phagocytic ''Dictyostelium'' has a total of six copine genes[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16343335  (Damer et al. 2005)]. The widespread distribution of copines from protozoans to mammals and their high similarity suggest they play important role(s) in eukaryotic biology.

DDB_G0267830	Petra Fey	''Dictyostelium'' GemA is a member of the evolutionarily conserved mitochondrial Rho (Miro) subgroup of GTPases. These are large, atypical Rho GTPases that recently have been described as Ras-related GTPases. They have a unique domain organisation with tandem GTP-binding domains and two EF hand domains that may bind calcium ([/ontology/go/5509/annotation/page/1 calcium ion binding]). The yeast Gem1p is a tail-anchored [/ontology/go/5741/annotation/page/1 mitochondrial outer membrane] protein that regulates mitochondrial morphology. ''Dictyostelium'' GemA contains a putative C-terminal transmembrane domain, which might anchor the protein in the mitochondrial outer membrane.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 16-JAN-2006 PF
DDB_G0276887	Pascale Gaudet	FbxA belongs to a family of proteins that contain an F-box and WD40 repeats and that target specific proteins for degradation via proteasomes ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10898960 Nelson et al. 2001]). The F-box is a protein motif of approximately 50 amino acids that functions as a site of protein-protein interaction ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11178263 Kipreos and Pagano 2000]). This class of protein usually forms part of a <u>S</u>kp1, <u>C</u>ullin, <u>F</u>-box [/ontology/go/0019005/annotation/page/1 SCF ubiquitin ligase complex] that targets specific protein substrates for ubiquitination and degradation ([/ontology/go/0006511/annotation/page/1 ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10725352 Ennis et al. 2000]).One of the targets of FbxA is the cAMP phosphodiesterase [/gene/DDB_G0284331 regA] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12796307 Tekinay et al. 2003]).<br />In fruiting bodies formed from ''fbxA'' null cells, most structures arrest at the mound stage, and in those that progress further the spore mass fails to fully ascend the stalk. The development of ''fbxA'' null cells is hypersensitive to ammonia, the signaling molecule that regulates [/ontology/go/0031154/annotation/page/1 culmination during sorocarp development]. In ''fbxA'' null slugs the pstO region is reduced in size and the prespore region is proportionately expanded ([/ontology/go/0045595/annotation/page/1 regulation of cell differentiation]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10898960 Nelson et al. 2001]). ''fbxA'' (Cheater A) was independently isolated as a ''Dictyostelium'' mutant that preferentially form spores in chimeras with isogenic wild-type cells. The mutant causes wild-type cells that have begun to express spore-specific genes to accumulate in the prestalk compartment of the developing organism ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10725352 Ennis et al. 2000]).<br />The ''fbxA'' transcript is absent in growing cells and appears early in development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10725352 Ennis et al. 2000]) and is highly enriched in the prestalk cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10898960 Nelson et al. 2001]). <br />Overexpression of the PKA catalytic subunit, [/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC], rescues many of the defects of ''fbxA'' null cells, suggesting a regulatory role for FbxA proteins in PKA function. FbxA is believed to regulate multicellular development together with [/gene/DDB_G0291972 culA] by targeting [/gene/DDB_G0284331 regA] for degradation via a pathway that requires [/gene/DDB_G0283903 erkB] function, leading to an increase in cAMP and PKA activity ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11390363 Mohanty et al. 2001]).Null mutations in [/gene/DDB_G0284331 regA] or [/gene/DDB_G0280961 dhkA] partially restores the developmental defects observed in ''fbxA'' null cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12796307 Tekinay et al. 2003]). <br />Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 16-JUN-2003 PG

DDB_G0268638	Pascale Gaudet	''Dictyostelium'' is the simplest organism known to employ STAT signaling. STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) proteins are characterized by a DNA binding domain, an SH2 domain, and a site of tyrosine phosphorylation. A STAT becomes activated when a ligand binds to its receptor, inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of the monomeric STAT molecule. Four STATs have been identified in ''Dictyostelium'', [/gene/DDB_G0281381 dstA], [/gene/DDB_G0268638 dstB], [/gene/DDB_G0293532 dstC] and [/gene/DDB_G0275167 dstD]. <br />STATb was isolated by low stringency hybridization using the SH2 domain of STATa as a probe. STATb displays a 15 amino acid insertion in its SH2 domain and the conserved and essential arginine residue,which interacts with phosphotyrosine in all other known SH2 domains, is substituted by leucine. Despite these abnormalities, STATb is biologically functional and is found as a homodimer in the [/ontology/go/0005634/annotation/page/1 nucleus]. ''dstB''-null cells aregradually lost from the population when they are co-culturedwith parental cells ([/ontology/go/0001558/annotation/page/1 regulation of cell growth]). Microarray analysis lead to the identification of several genes that are either underexpressed ([/ontology/go/0016563/annotation/page/1 transcription activator activity]) oroverexpressed ([/ontology/go/0016564/annotation/page/1 transcription repressor activity]) in the ''dstB'' null strain ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14701681 Zhukovskaya et al. 2004]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 28-MAY-2004 PG
DDB_G0277403	Pascale Gaudet	Clathrin is part of the vesicles coat involved in [/ontology/go/0006897/annotation/page/1 endocytosis] from the plasma membrane, as well as traffic from endosomes and the trans-Golgi network. The clathrin protein is composed of three 190-kDa heavy chains (encoded by [/gene/DDB_G0277221 chcA]) and three ~30-kDa light chains (encoded by ''clc'') to form the clathrin triskelion ([/ontology/go/0030118/annotation/page/1 clathrin coat]). Clathrin heavy chains from different species are highly conserved, while clathrin light chains are much more divergent. <br />Unlike the [/gene/DDB_G0277221 chcA] mutant, ''clc'' null cells grow normally on solid substratum and have pinocytosis rates similar to that of parent cells. ''clcA'' knockouts have defects in [/ontology/go/0048268/annotation/page/1 clathrin cage assembly], in [/ontology/go/0031154/annotation/page/1 culmination during sorocarp development], [/ontology/go/0000910/annotation/page/1 cytokinesis], and [/ontology/go/0009992/annotation/page/1 cellular water homeostasis] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14617352 Wang et al. 2003]).<br />Deletion analysis of the Clc protein has shown that the carboxyl terminus, which is highly conserved across different organisms, can rescue the cytokinesis and the developmental defects of ''clc'' null cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16734666 Wang et al. 2006]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 30-AUG-2004 PG

DDB_G0289511	Pascale Gaudet	There are 29 genes encoding actin in ''Dictyostelium'' with amino acid identity greater than 83%, ''act1''-''act29''.

Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in ''Dictyostelium'', constituting approximately 8% of the total protein in vegetative cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/561722 Alton and Lodish et al. 1977]).Actin synthesis is developmentally regulated, peaking shortly after starvation (reviewed by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6894564 Firtel] in 1981).

DDB_G0282819	Pascale Gaudet	Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S-1-P) is a bioactive lipid that plays a role in diverse biological processes, including cell proliferation, cell death, cell movement and chemotaxis. In animal cells, it functions both as an extracellular ligand, and intracellularly as a second messenger. ''sglA'', the ''Dictyostelium'' gene encoding sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase, was isolated as a REMI mutant having increased resistance to cisplatin. The mutant produces short fruiting bodies with a thick stalk and a drastically reduced number of spores ([/ontology/go/0030435/annotation/page/1 sporulation]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10974109 Li et al. 2000], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11566853 2001]). Null mutants in ''sglA'' have reduced [/ontology/go/0006935/annotation/page/1 chemotaxis] rates towards cAMP and decreased ability to repress lateral pseudopod formation ([/ontology/go/0031276/annotation/page/1 negative regulation of lateral pseudopodium formation]). Interestingly, the defects in the S-1-P lyase null mutants are similar to those seen in mutants lacking the genes for [/gene/DDB_G0280039 myoA], [/gene/DDB_G0289117 myoB], and [/gene/DDB_G0277221 chcA] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15476260 Kumar et al. 2004]).

DDB_G0291972	Pascale Gaudet	CulA is a member of the cullin family of proteins that function as scaffolds that, along with F-box/WD40-repeat-containing proteins, mediate the ubiquitination of proteins to target them for degradation by the proteasome ([/ontology/go/0004842/annotation/page/1 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity]). ''culA'' null cells are defective in inducing cell-type-specific gene expression and exhibit defects during aggregation, including reduced chemotaxis ([/ontology/go/0030154/annotation/page/1 cell differentiation]), ([/ontology/go/0006935/annotation/page/1 chemotaxis]). <br />Overexpression of the PKA catalytic subunit ([/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC]) rescues many of the ''culA'' null defects, as well as those of cells lacking [/gene/DDB_G0276887 fbxA], a F-box/WD40-repeat-containing protein, Whereas [/gene/DDB_G0284331 regA] protein levels drop as the multicellular organism forms in the wild-type strain, they remain high in ''culA'' null and ''fbxA'' null cells. CulA, FbxA, and RegA are found in a complex ''in vivo'' ([/ontology/go/0019005/annotation/page/1 SCF ubiquitin ligase complex]), and formation of this complex is dependent on the MAP kinase ERK2 ([/gene/DDB_G0283903 erkB]), which is also required for PKA function. This data suggest a model in which CulA and FbxA regulate multicellular development by targeting RegA for degradation via a pathway that requires ERK2 function, leading to an increase in cAMP and PKA activity [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11390363  (Mohanty et al. 2001)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 3-JUN-2008 PF

DDB_G0286183	Pascale Gaudet	''agps'' is an oxidoreductase with [/ontology/go/0008609/annotation/page/1 alkylglycerone-phosphate synthase activity], responsible for the formation of alkyldihydroxyacetonephosphate (alkyl-DHAP) through the exchange of the acyl moiety of acyl-DHAP with a fatty alcohol. This reaction required FAD. This essential reaction generates the ether bond in the [/ontology/go/0008611/annotation/page/1 ether lipid biosynthetic process]. In other organisms, this takes place in the [/ontology/go/0005777/annotation/page/1 peroxisome]. Consistent with this, the ''Dictyostelium'' protein has a type 1 peroxisomal targeting signal at the C terminus.<br />The ''Dictyostelium'' Agps protein has been crystallized ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17562315 Razeto et al., 2007], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17601746 Razeto et al., 2007]). The catalytic site contains five conserved residues: Asp237, Arg352,Arg447, Glu461, and Tyr508. Mutagenesis of the Arg352 residue diminishes agps activity, while mutation of Tyr508 abolishes the activity. <br />Defects in human ''AGPS'' causes rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP), a peroxisomal disorder defined by the inability of patients to synthesize ether phospholipids. This results in serious developmental defects and death before 10 years of age. <br />Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 18-DEC-2007 PG

DDB_G0276353	Pascale Gaudet	The TorA protein is a novel protein with predicted coiled-coil motif near its carboxy terminus. The protein is localized to large clusters at one end of the [/ontology/go/0005739/annotation/page/1 mitochondrion]. <br />''torA'' was isolated during a REMI mutant screen for genes required for chemotaxis.

The defects caused by mutations in ''torA'' are rescued by expression of [/gene/DDB_G0269152 mekA].

DDB_G0277221	Pascale Gaudet	Clathrin is part of the vesicles coat ([/ontology/go/0030118/annotation/page/1 clathrin coat]) involved in endocytosis from the plasma membrane, as well as traffic from endosomes and the trans-Golgi network. The clathrin protein is composed of three 190-kDa heavy chains (encoded by ''chcA'') and three ~30-kDa light chains ([/gene/DDB_G0277403 clc]) that form the clathrin triskelion.<br />The ''Dictyostelium'' clathrin heavy chain sequence has 57% identity with the mammalian protein. mRNA levels are highest during vegetative growth and decline as the cells progress through development. The concentration of clathrin heavy-chain protein is the same in cells grown in liquid media (high rates of pinocytosis) as in cells grown with bacteria([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1605855 O'Halloran and Anderson 1992]). GFP-clathrin distribute into punctate loci found throughout the cytoplasm, on the plasma membrane, and concentrated to a perinuclear location([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10848635 Damer and O'Halloran 2000]). ''chcA'' null mutants have reduced pinocytosis and defective processing and localization of lysosomal protein ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8034739 Ruscetti et al. 1994]).In addition, these mutants display about 40% of the level of extracellular cyclic AMP binding normally found in wild-type cellsAggregation is delayed, and the fruiting bodies have an irregular shape. ''chcA''- cells failed to sort correctly and never produced functional spores([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9053320 Niswonger and O'Halloran 1997]). ''chcA''- cells have defective cytokinesis in suspension that result from their inability to assemble myosin II into a functional contractile ring ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9238018 Niswonger and O'Halloran 1997], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11223952 Gerald et al. 2001]). Study of cell motility using the ''chcA'' muatnt suggests that clathrin suppresses pseudopod formation and stabilizes the uropod in the posterior half of a crawling cell ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10591622 Wessel et al. 2000]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 30-AUG-2004 PG
DDB_G0274387	Pascale Gaudet	''Dictyostelium'' development is sensitive to Li+ treatment. Mutants that lack the ''dpoA'' gene, encoding a prolyl oligopeptidase, are able to develop in the presence of Li+. Prolyl oligopeptidases [EC 3.4.21.26] are endopeptidases that cleave Pro-X amino acid bonds on small polypeptides ([/ontology/go/0006508/annotation/page/1 proteolysis]), ([/ontology/go/0004287/annotation/page/1 prolyl oligopeptidase activity]). Inositol (1,4,5) trisphosphate (IP3) levels, known to be affected by Li+, are increased in the ''dpoA'' mutant ([/ontology/go/0009966/annotation/page/1 regulation of signal transduction]). IP3 concentrations increase via an unconventional mechanism that involves enhanced dephosphorylation of inositol (1,3,4,5,6) pentakisphosphate. Loss of DpoA activity therefore counteracts the reduction in IP3 concentration caused by Li+ treatment. No genetic interaction was observed with [/gene/DDB_G0272110 gskA], another major cellular target of Li+ ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10329620 Williams et al. 1999]).

DDB_G0272837	Pascale Gaudet	''ifkA'' and [/gene/DDB_G0276829 ifkB] encode homologs of a kinase that phosphorylate the translation initiation factor eIF2alpha ([/ontology/go/0004686/annotation/page/1 elongation factor-2 kinase activity]), ([/ontology/go/0006445/annotation/page/1 regulation of translation]). The two Ifk proteins possess all of the hallmarks of typical GCN2 proteins, including the characteristic kinase domain and the HisRS domain. ''ifkA'' is expressed during growth and drops dramatically soon after the onset of development. <br />Disruption of the ''ifkA'' gene causes defects in early development. ''ifkA'' null cells aggregate earlier than parental cells due to a more rapid establishment of the cAMP pulsing system. Cells lacking a functional IfkA protein form larger mounds and subsequent developmental structures ([/ontology/go/0007275/annotation/page/1 multicellular organismal development]), ([/ontology/go/0009653/annotation/page/1 anatomical structure morphogenesis]). This defect was linked to a reduced extracellular level of Countin ([/gene/DDB_G0274597 ctnA]). Efficient translation of ''ctnA'' mRNA requires increased phosphorylation of eIF2a by IfkA [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12697064 (Fang et al. 2003)].<br />In ''Dictyostelium'', two members of the GCN2 (also known as PEK, pancreatic eukaryotic translation initiation factor kinase) family of protein kinases have been identified: [/gene/DDB_G0272837 ifkA] and[/gene/DDB_G0276829 ifkB].

DDB_G0267418	Karen Kestin	S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) catalyzes the reaction S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + H<sub>2</sub>O =L-homocysteine + adenosine. S-[/ontology/go/0004013/annotation/page/1 adenosylhomocysteinase activity] was first characterized in ''Dictyostelium'' in a [/ontology/go/0030552/annotation/page/1 cAMP binding] protein with a molecular weight of 47 kilodaltons that likely exists as a 190 kilodaltontetramer ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6299402 Gunzburg et al. 1983]). The ''sahA'' gene was later identifiedand cloned, and its amino acid sequence is highly conserved with mammalian SAHH ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3288206 Kasir etal. 1988], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3139100 Guitton et al. 1988]). The biochemistry of SahAhas been extensively studied and has been shown to be activated by bound NAD+ and reversibly inactivated by cAMP andthe adenosine analog 2'-deoxyadenosine ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6319183 Hohman and Veron 1984], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6091559 Hohman et al. 1984]). Inactivation of the SahA protein by cAMP occurs via dissociationof SahA from NAD+, however, inactivation by 2'-deoxyadenosine is through the reduction of bound NAD+ to NADH ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2991881 Hohman et al. 1985]).<br />Cellular localization of SahA has been observed in the [/ontology/go/0005737/annotation/page/1 cytoplasm], in the [/ontology/go/0005634/annotation/page/1 nucleus], and in the [/ontology/go/0005938/annotation/page/1 cell cortex] of vegetative amoeba ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15358428 Yamada and Sameshima 2004]) and in the [/ontology/go/0031252/annotation/page/1 leading edge] of chemotaxing cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17172447 Shu et al. 2006]).

DDB_G0268258	Robert Dodson	The motor domain in the kinesin encoded by ''kif12'' belongs to the MKLP1 family of mitotic kinesins and is found near the N-terminus but preceeded by a 120 aa extension [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14641909  (Kollmar and Glockner 2003)]. Kif12 has two nuclear localization signals that localize it to the nucleus during interphase. As cells enter metaphase, Kif12 leaves for the cytoplasm and localizes along spindle fibers [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15546981  (Lakshmikanth et al. 2004)]. Cells in which ''kif12'' is deleted are unable to grow in suspension but can multiply by traction-mediated cytofission when attached to a surface submerged by medium. Under these conditions, the large, multinucleated mutant cells divide asymmetrically, forming smaller cells that survive as long as they capture at least one nucleus. Very little myosin II ([/gene/DDB_G0286355 mhcA]), accumulates in the cleavage furrow and the rate of separation of the nuclei during karyokinesis is reduced. It was suggested that Kif12 might transport vesicles containing myosin II along mitotic extranuclear microtubules towards the center of the cell to be inserted into the cleavage furrow membrane [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15546981  (Lakshmikanth et al. 2004)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22379107  (Kee et al. 2012)]. Like each of the other mitotic kinesins, ''kif12'' mRNA levels are low in growing cells and increase to relatively high levels between 12 and 18 hrs of development before returning to very low levels [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 02-OCT-2017 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0288361	Robert Dodson	The motor domain in the kinesin encoded by ''kif13'' belongs to the BimC/Eg5 family of mitotic kinesins that drive spindle pole separation during mitosis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14641909  (Kollmar and Glockner 2003)]. Kif13 was found to co-purify along with more than 80 other proteins in samples enriched in centrosomes [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16512674  (Reinders et al. 2006)]. ''kif13'' null cells grow at rates indistinguishable from wild type suggesting that other kinesins can substitute for any vital roles of Kif13. However, the spindle halves separate prematurely in ''kif13'' null cells, indicating that Kif13 may play a specialized role in maintaining spindle integrity at the terminal stages of division [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18712789  (Tikhonenko et al. 2008)]. Like each of the other mitotic kinesins, kif13 mRNA levels are low in growing cells and increase to relatively high levels between 12 and 18 hrs of development before returning to very low levels [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 03-OCT-2017 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

DDB_G0292266	Pascale Gaudet	''amdA'' encodes AMP deaminase which functions in the interconversion of purines ([/ontology/go/0003876/annotation/page/1 AMP deaminase activity]), ([/ontology/go/0009167/annotation/page/1 purine ribonucleoside monophosphate metabolic process]). ''amdA'' is contitutively expressed in ''Dictyostelium''. Disruption of the ''amdA'' gene results in short, thick stalks and glassy sori with less than 5% the normal number of spores, indicating a defect in [/ontology/go/0030435/annotation/page/1 sporulation]. These cell also have a significantly increased proportion of prestalk cells of the pstA type. This alteration in cell-type proportioning is a cell-autonomous consequence of the loss of AMP deaminase ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11784104 Chae et al. 2002]).<br />A recently characterized ''Dictyostelium'' cell type, the aspidocyte, is highly resistant to detergents and develops in the presence of a number of toxic chemicals, including heavy metals, inhibitors of sterol, protein or RNA synthesis and of mitosis. ''amdA''- cells form aspidocyte more readily than wild type cells. Since ''amdA''- cells have higher AMP levels compared to wild type cells, this could be a signal for aspidocyte differentiation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17259634 Serafimidis et al. 2007]).

DDB_G0272875	Petra Fey	''Dictyostelium cpnB'' belongs to the highly conserved copines, a family of ubiquitious Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipid-binding ([/ontology/go/0005544/annotation/page/1 calcium-dependent phospholipid binding]) proteins. In their N-terminal half, copines contain two Ca(2+)- and phospholipid-binding domains (C2 domains) present in such proteins as phospholipase C and protein kinase C. Much of the C-terminal half consists of a von Willebrand Factor type A domain (VWFA) typically found in the extracellular portions of membrane proteins like integrins. Thus copines represent a fusion of intracellular (C2) and extracellular (VWFA) domains. However, there are no signal sequence or hydrophobic transmembrane sequences in the predicted proteins suggesting copines are intracellular proteins. Copines are thought to be involved in membrane trafficking. It is of particular interest that copines, first found in the highly phagocytic protozoan ''Paramecium'' and then isolated from mammalian spleen and liver, seem to be abundant in cells and organs that are, or contain, phagocytes. In this context it comes as no surprise that phagocytic ''Dictyostelium'' has a total of six copine genes[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16343335  (Damer et al. 2005)].

DDB_G0271916	Pascale Gaudet	''rtoA'' was initially isolated by shotgun antisense cDNA as a gene required for [/ontology/go/0030587/annotation/page/1 sorocarp development] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8643519 Spann et al., 1996]). Defects in ''rtoA'' results in cells that have an abnormally high percentage of prestalk cells. Unlike wild type cells, ''rtoA'' mutant cells' propensity to differentate into prestalk or prespore cells is independent of their position in the cell cycle at starvation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8951083 Wood et al., 1996]). RtoA levels vary during the cell cycle. During development, expression of RtoA is restricted to prespore cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10747962 Brazill et al., 2000]). ''rtoA''- cells have aberrant regulation of calcium levels during the cell cycle, indicating that [/ontology/go/0006874/annotation/page/1 cellular calcium ion homeostasis] may be linked to the [/ontology/go/0045595/annotation/page/1 regulation of cell differentiation] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11330860 Azhar et al., 2001]). The ''rtoA''- mutation affects the [/ontology/go/0006885/annotation/page/1 regulation of pH] in the cytosol as well as in the endocytic and exocytic vesicles. The RtoA protein contains several repeats of a serine-rich motif, which catalyzes the fusion of phospholipid vesicles ''in vitro''. Consistent with a role in [/ontology/go/0006944/annotation/page/1 membrane fusion], ''rtoA''- cells have a defect in the fusion of endocytic vesicles and decreased [/ontology/go/0006887/annotation/page/1 exocytosis] rates ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10747962 Brazill et al., 2000]).<br />Partial uppression of the ''rtoA'' phenotype can be observed in an insertional mutant that disrupts both [/gene/DDB_G0275689 abcG2] and [/gene/DDB_G0275687 abcG18] (''mdrA1/mdrA2''). The triple null ''abcG2-/abcG18-/rtoA-'' has greatly reduced endocytosis rates. Also, the cytosolic and endosomal pH of ''abcG2-/abcG18-/rtoA-'' are abnormal, indicating that the product of these genes are required for proper [/ontology/go/0048388/annotation/page/1 endosomal lumen acidification] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11719559 Brazill et al., 2001]).<br />''rtoA''- cells are more resistant to infection by the pathogen ''Legionella pneumophila'', probably because due to their defect in endocytic vesicles fusion ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15679845 Li et al., 2005]). It is also less efficient at phagocytosing the fungus ''Cryptococcus neoformans'', although once ingested, ''C. neoformans'' replicates as well in ''rtoA-'' mutants as in wild type cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12933827 Steenbergen et al., 2001]).<br />A region of the ''rtoA'' promoter necessary for the response to osmotic stress have been identified (Tsujioka and Williams 2007, personnal communication to dictyBase; the complete communication is available on the '''rtoA Community Annotation Page''', see link just above the Summary). The region between -144 and 256 relative to the start codon of the Curated Model is essential for up-regulation of ''rtoA'' following exposure to 100 mM sorbitol.

DDB_G0272568	Petra Fey	''Dictyostelium'' cofilin-2 (''cofC'') was identified as a cofilin-related protein from the ''Dictyostelium'' cDNA project. It has significant homology to conventional cofilin [/gene/DDB_G0277833 cofA] and contains residues responsible for actin binding ([/ontology/go/0003779/annotation/page/1 actin binding]). Cofilin-2 was shown to depolimerize actin filaments ([/ontology/go/0030042/annotation/page/1 actin filament depolymerization]) in a dose- and pH-dependent manner and to decrease the viscosity of an actin solution, but it did not co-sediment with actin filaments.

Immunohistochemistry showed that cofilin-2 colocalized with actin at substrate adhesion sites. However, disruption of the ''cofC'' gene did not result in any adhesion defect, mutants appeared to be normal. Cofilin-2 did not rescue a yeast mutant deficient in conventional cofilin, suggesting ''cofC'' has different function(s) than ''cofA''.

DDB_G0277859	Petra Fey	The ''mlcE'' gene codes for the essential myosin light chain (ELC) of myosin II. Antisense or mlcE-null mutants resemble [/gene/DDB_G0286355 mhcA] mutants. They grow poorly in suspension and become large and multinucleate. Despite the cytokinesis ([/ontology/go/0000910/annotation/page/1 cytokinesis]) defect myosin localizaion in the cells was shown to be normal. While mlcE- cells are able to respond to chemoattractant with proper directionality, their rate of movement is reduced ([/ontology/go/0006928/annotation/page/1 cell motility]). Aggregation is delayed, and only 50 % of the aggregates progress further to form shorter fruiting bodies with thicker stalks ([/ontology/go/0030587/annotation/page/1 sorocarp development]). Studies using lacZ reporter constructs expressed from cell type specific promoters showed the localization of prespore cells is more susceptible to the loss of ELC ([/ontology/go/0016477/annotation/page/1 cell migration]) than prestalk cells. In myosin purified from the mlcE- cells the actin-activated ATPase activity ([/ontology/go/0030898/annotation/page/1 actin-dependent ATPase activity]) was greatly reduced. This result and the proper localization of myosin in mlcE- cells suggest that its phenotypic defects primarily arise from defective contractile function of myosin rather than its mislocalization [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1535025  (Pollenz et al. 1992)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7593282  (Chen et al. 1995)]. <br />Deletion mutations showed that both the amino and carboxyl termini of the ELC are required for binding to the myosin heavy chain (MHC). When these mutants were analyzed for their ability to complement the cytokinesis defect displayed by mlcE- cells, a correlation to the level of ELC carried by the MHC was observed, indicating that a stoichiometric ELC-MHC association is necessary for normal myosin function in vivo [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7499275  (Ho et al. 1995)]. The ELC wraps around an alpha-helix that extends from the myosin head, where it is believed to play a structural support role. However, substitution mutations of charged residues in loops I, II, III, and helix G of the ELC lead to reduced actin-activated ATPase activity despite stoichiometric binding to the heavy chain. This result suggests that the ELC contributes to myosin's enzymatic activity in addition to providing structural support for the alpha-helical neck region of MHC [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9020178  (Ho et al. 1997)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-SEP-2003 PF

DDB_G0284601	Petra Fey	CK2 (casein kinase II), a ubiquitous serine/threonine kinase, is one of the most highly conserved proteins in eukaryotic cells. The protein kinase usually forms a tetramer, comprised of two catalytic alpha or alpha' subunits, and two regulatory beta subunits. The ''Dictyostelium'' [/gene/DDB_G0276885 casK] gene encodes a previously cloned CK2 alpha chain [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1448100  (Kikkawa et al., 1992)]. In addition, the ''Dictyostelium'' genome contains another putative alpha chain [/gene/DDB_G0286481 DDB_G0286481], and a single ortholog of the CK2 beta chain, ''csnk2b''. <br />The CK2 alpha chain encoded by [/gene/DDB_G0276885 casK] has been identified by PCR, based on similarity. Northern blot analysis of [/gene/DDB_G0276885 casK] during development, as well as CK2 activity ([/ontology/go/0004682/annotation/page/1 protein kinase CK2 activity]) throughout development both show a constitutive expression and presence of CK2 during the ''Dictyostelium'' life cycle. Attempts to delete the ''casK'' gene failed, indicating that it is an essential gene [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1448100  (Kikkawa et al., 1992)]. However, in yeast, which has two CK2 genes, only (haploid) cells carrying disruptions in both CK2 alpha chains are inviable [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2196445  (Padmanabha et al., 1990)].<br />Protein kinase CK2 represents a family of closely related kinases with broad specifity. There are hundreds of target molecules, implicating CK2 in many signalling pathways ([/ontology/go/0007165/annotation/page/1 signal transduction]), including such involved in cell survival. For recent reviews see [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12396231  (Litchfield, 2003)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12631575  (Meggio &amp; Pinnal, 2003)], and [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12062170  (Ahmed et al., 2002)]. <br />The presence of a second putative CK2 alpha- and one putative CK2 beta chain in ''Dictyostelium'' suggests that the tetrameric holoenzyme in this organism consists of two different alpha chains and two identical beta chains. However, currently there is no eperimental evidence that these putative genes are expressed and further investigation is necessary.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 10-MAY-2004 PF

DDB_G0273995	Petra Fey	The ''icmA'' gene encodes the conserved isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase in ''Dictyostelium''. The protein was shown to have [/ontology/go/0004671/annotation/page/1 protein-S-isoprenylcysteine O-methyltransferase activity]. The ''icmA''-null mutant shows defects in early development, such as no cell polarization ([/ontology/go/0030010/annotation/page/1 establishment of cell polarity]) or streaming, aberrant cAMP wave formation, and in some cases loose mound formation that may proceed to form aberrant fruiting bodies ([/ontology/go/0060176/annotation/page/1 regulation of aggregation involved in sorocarp development]). In the mutant, the starvation-induced expression of the cAMP receptor [/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1] is delayed, also reflected in the fact that mutant membranes bind only 34% of the CAMP that wild-type membranes bind. However, in pulsed mutant cells the cAMP relay response is 3 times larger than in wild type. In addition, Ras GTPase ([/gene/DDB_G0293434 rasG]) has been shown to be methylated and in the ''icmA''-null mutant RasG, as well as CRAC ([/gene/DDB_G0285161 dagA]) are mislocalized in cAMP-pulsed cells. In sum, these data show that isoprenylcysteine methylation is required for signalling in response to cAMP ([/ontology/go/0008277/annotation/page/1 regulation of G-protein coupled receptor protein signaling pathway]) and development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17699599 Chen et al. 2007)].

DDB_G0283983	Robert Dodson	The ''hnfA'' gene is DIF induced, expressed in pstO cells and is essential for normal development. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21389049  (Blagg et al. 2011)] demonstrated that ''hfnA'' is important for the timing of culmination, the regulation of slug movement and localisation of pstO cells. HfnA appears to regulate the activity of filamin complexes, which are in turn needed for phototactic slug migration and correct cell type motility and patterning during development. These studies provide the first step in defining the molecular relationship between the input DIF-1 signal and output cell type-specific behaviours that lead to sorting out. <br /> Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 15-APR-2014 RD

DDB_G0277831	Petra Fey	A family of four highly related cell-surface receptors is responsible for the responses to cAMP at different stages of development in ''Dictyostelium''. The members are all 7 transmembrane G protein-coupled proteins but show different affinities to cAMP as well as different cell type specificities [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2049880  (Saxe et al., 1991]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7496377  Ginsburg et al., 1995)]. ''carD'' is expressed from late aggregation to culmination and encodes the low affinity CAR4 receptor that is enriched in prestalk cells and controls cytodifferentiation during late stages of development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1537842  (Johnson et al., 1992]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7958880  Louis et al., 1994)]. <br />CAR4 plays an essential role in regulating expression of certain prestalk specific genes by inactivating the protein kinase GSK3 (gene ''[/gene/DDB_G0272110 gskA]''). Furthermore, CAR4 stimulates a protein tyrosine phosphatase that removes the phosphate from GSK3, reducing its activity [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12408804  (Kim et al., 2002]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9284050  Ginsburg and Kimmel, 1997)]. CAR3 on the other hand, has a higher affinity for cAMP and activates GSK3 by stimulating the protein tyrosine kinase ZAK1 (gene ''[/gene/DDB_G0276025 zakA]''; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15380246  Kimmel and Firtel, 2004)]. Thus, CAR3 and CAR4 antagonistically regulate GSK3 to establish cell fate choice. CAR3 signaling favors prespore differentiation and CAR4 signaling favors prestalk differentiation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12408804  (Kim et al., 2002)]. It has been suggested that cell-type specific expression of receptors with different affinities for cAMP directs pattern formation in response to regional differences in cAMP concentration ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7958880  Louis et al., 1994)]. Further studies indicated that the switching of cAMP receptor subtypes during development enables the organism to respond to changing concentrations of the chemoattractant and thus program morphogenesis appropriately [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9578623  (Kim et al., 1998)].

DDB_G0277829	Petra Fey	A family of four highly related G-protein coupled receptors, CAR1, CAR2, CAR3, and CAR4 (genes ''[/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1]'' ''[/gene/DDB_G0288179 carB]'', ''[/gene/DDB_G0277829 carC]'', ''[/gene/DDB_G0277831 carD]'', respectively), mediate developmental responses to cAMP [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2049880  (Saxe et al., 1991]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7496377  Ginsburg et al., 1995)]. CAR1 and CAR3 have 56% amino acid identity and show approximately equal affinity to cAMP in vitro [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1537842  (Johnson et al., 1992)]. Both are coupled to trimeric G proteins with the Galpha2 subunit. CAR1 is expressed immediately after the initiation of development while CAR3 onset of expression is in tight aggregates. There are approximately 5,000 CAR3 sites per cell. Disruption of carC does not result in an obvious phenotype [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8382181  (Johnson et al., 1993)]. Disruption of ''carA'' on the other hand results in cells that are unable to aggregate but can still respond to added cAMP by relaying the signal and synthesizing cGMP as long as 100X higher concentrations of cAMP are used than needed for signaling in wild type cells. However, a double ''carA'' / ''carC'' mutant lacking both receptors shows no response to cAMP and an abolished synthesis of cGMP phenotype [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7949426  (Insall et al., 1994)].<br />CAR3 has a high affinity for cAMP and activates GSK3 (gene ''[/gene/DDB_G0272110 gskA]'') by stimulating the protein tyrosine kinase ZAK1 (gene ''[/gene/DDB_G0276025 zakA]''; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15380246  Kimmel and Firtel, 2004)]. On the other hand, the lower affinity CAR4 receptor stimulates a protein tyrosine phosphatase that removes the phosphate from GSK3, reducing its activity [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12408804  (Kim et al., 2002]. Thus, CAR3 and CAR4 antagonistically regulate GSK3 to establish cell fate choice.

DDB_G0278495	Petra Fey	One of the first enzyme activities seen to increase specifically during ''Dictyostelium'' development was alkaline phosphatase [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13563787  (Krivanek and Krivanek, 1956 ]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14329960  Gezelius and Wright, 1965 ]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5344104  Loomis, 1969) ]. Both a 5' nucleotidase and a classical alkaline phosphatase contribute to the activity assayed with the chromogenic substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Mutant strains carrying deletions of ''alp'' lack the classical alkaline phosphatase but retain the 5' nucleotidase; they develop just as well as wild type strains in the laboratory [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12717731  (Rutherford et al. 2003)]. In vegetative cells, alkaline phosphatase is found in vesicles associated with the plasma membrane rather than with cisternae of the contractile vacuole complex [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15511086  (Clarke and Maddera, 2004)]. <br />The specific activity of alkaline phosphatase increases first in early development and is highest during culmination. It is expressed in prestalk regions during development and in the lower and upper cup of the fruiting body [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12204284  (Ubeidat et al. 2002)]. Synthesis of mRNA can be inhibited as early as 10 hrs after development onset without affecting the increase in alkaline phosphatase during culmination [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5344104  (Loomis, 1969)]. Direct measurement by RNA-seq showed that ''alp'' mRNA had accumulated to near maximal levels by 10 hrs of development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. Since the enzyme does not accumulate significantly until culmination, translation or enzyme stability appears to be subject to developmental regulation.

DDB_G0287875	Robert Dodson	The ''dydA'' gene was identified through a bioinformatics screen for proteins with potential Ras/Rap1 binding domains. DydA was found to be a new member of the MRL family of adaptor proteins that localizes to the leading edge of chemotaxing cells. ''dydA'' null cells exhibit chemotaxis defects, as well as elevated F-actin and assembled myosin II levels, increased and extended phosphoinositide-3-kinase activity, and extended phosphorylation of PKB and PKBR1. In addition, DydA was shown to bind RasG, and to be phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 3. Based on these results, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23135995  Koelsch et al. 2013] propose that DydA helps integrate the function of several signaling pathways to regulate cell polarity and chemotaxis.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 18-OCT-2005 PF

DDB_G0277671	Pascale Gaudet	DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates ([/ontology/go/0003899/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase activity]). Three distinct zinc-containing RNA polymerases are found in eukaryotic nuclei: [/gene/DDB_G0275759 rpa1] for the ribosomal RNA precursor ([/ontology/go/0006360/annotation/page/1 transcription from RNA polymerase I promoter]), ([/ontology/go/0005736/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase I complex]), [/gene/DDB_G0279193 rpb1] for the mRNA precursor ([/ontology/go/0006366/annotation/page/1 transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter]), ([/ontology/go/0005665/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase II, core complex]), and [/gene/DDB_G0277199 rpc1] for 5S and tRNA genes ([/ontology/go/0006383/annotation/page/1 transcription from RNA polymerase III promoter]), ([/ontology/go/0005666/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase III complex]).<br />RNA polymerase III is a multisubunit complex. The subunits encoded by [/gene/DDB_G0277199 rpc1] (ortholog of ''S. cerevisiae RPO31''), [/gene/DDB_G0293560 rpa2] (''RPC2''), [/gene/DDB_G0268080 rpc3] (''RPC82''),[/gene/DDB_G0277671 rpc4] (''RPC53''), [/gene/DDB_G0271514 rpc5] (''RPC37''), [/gene/DDB_G0286521 rpc9] (''RPC17''), [/gene/DDB_G0272022 rpc34] (''RPC34''), [/gene/DDB_G0273425 rpc25-1] (''RPC25''), and [/gene/DDB_G0287707 rpc11] (''RPC11'') are unique to RNA polymerase III. Orthologs of ''RPC31'' and ''RPC17'' have not been identified in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome. Two subunits, [/gene/DDB_G0291362 rpc19] and [/gene/DDB_G0282339 rpa5] (''RPC19'' and ''RPC40'' in ''S. cerevisiae''), are common to RNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase III and correspond to subunits 3 and 11 of RNA polymerase II. Subunits [/gene/DDB_G0291636 rpb5], [/gene/DDB_G0291037 rpb6], [/gene/DDB_G0278039 rpb8], [/gene/DDB_G0272036 rpb10], and [/gene/DDB_G0283365 rpb12] are common to all three RNA polymerases ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12407181 Peyroche et al. 2002], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12381659 Schramm and Hernandez 2001]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 11-JUN-2009 PG

DDB_G0288769	Robert Dodson	Research by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22239817  Sultana et al. 2012] showed that CAP, an important regulator of cell polarity, determines aggregation, cell adhesion and development in ''Dictyostelium discoideum''. Expression of CAP in ''acaA'' null cells led to the restoration of cell polarity, streaming and aggregation defects in ''acaA'' null mutants, but failed to completely restore development, suggesting the requirement of ACA and associated signaling for this process. In addition, the role of CAP in influencing the expression of cell adhesion molecules DdCAD1 and csA that mediate calcium-dependent and -independent cell adhesion, respectively, suggested that CAP acts at the intersection of signaling to link cell polarization to aggregation, cell adhesion and multicellular development.

DDB_G0268144	Robert Dodson	The ''vwkA'' gene has been demonstrated to play a role in contractile vacuole dynamics and in hypo-osmotic shock survival [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19843280  (Betapudi et al. 2009)]. ''vwkA'' null cells display large numbers of engorged contractile vacuoles that fail to undergo proper fusion with the plasma membrane. The authors further show that vwkA- cells have an aberrant cortical myosin II organization, and that perturbation of myosin II abundance or activity also results in defective contractile vacuole dynamics. Their results suggest a role for myosin II-based cytosolic tension in contractile function and for a role for VwkA in the regulation of these events.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 31-JAN-2014 RD

DDB_G0269424	Robert Dodson	''gxcB'' encodes a Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF, RacGEF). RacGEFs are key components of signaling networks in which they activate Rho family GTPases by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP. GxcB contains a domain organization of three calponin homology (CH) domains in its N-terminus and a typical GEF domain composed of a diffuse B-cell lymphoma homology (DH)/pleckstrin homology (PH) tandem domain at its C-terminus. ''gxcB'' is maximally expressed from the vegetative growth phase to early stages of development, with expression declining sharply after about 12 hr. of development. GxcB is localized to the cortical region and late endosomes. GxcB both binds to and bundles F-actin filaments. ''gxcB'' null mutants display slight irregularities in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and a slight delay in development; however there is a 30% reduction in the rate of exocytosis in the mutant cells. These results suggest that ''gxcB'' is involved in a signaling pathway that is required for regulation of the actin cytoskeleton during exocytosis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16781009 Strehle et al. 2006]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 25-JUN-2021 RD

DDB_G0269610	Robert Dodson	''gxcT'' encodes a Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF, RacGEF). RacGEFs are key components of signaling networks in which they activate Rho family GTPases by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP. GxcT localizes to the cytosol, both in the presence and absence of cAMP stimulation. ''gxcT'' null mutants have defects in both growth and cytokinesis. The mutants also have a developmental defect, failing to aggregate normally and forming smaller fruiting bodies. ''gxcT'' null mutants also have defects in chemotaxis to cAMP, with a reduced speed of chemotaxis and decreased directional accuracy of movement toward the cAMP source. The mutant cells are less polarized than wild type cells, and pseudopods often extended from the lateral sides of the cells. In response to cAMP gradients, PIP3 production and Ras activation are not well oriented toward the cAMP gradient in ''gxcT'' null cells suggesting that ''gxcT'' orients the position of PIP3 production and Ras activation in a chemoattractant gradient. ''racE'' ([/gene/DDB_G0280975 racE]) null cells display many of the same phenotypes as ''gxcT'' null mutants, and GxcT binds to RacE in a GST pull down assay. In addition, GxcT binds to Rac1C ([/gene/DDB_G0282365 rac1C]), RacC ([/gene/DDB_G0293526 racC]), and RacF1 ([/gene/DDB_G0269176 racF1]). These results suggest that GxcT has GEF activity toward ''racE'', and possibly toward ''rac1C'', ''racC'' and ''racF1'', and that GxcT and RacE are involved in a signaling pathway regulating the stability and orientation of spatial sensing during chemotaxis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24248334 Wang et al. 2013]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26940518 Rivero et al. 2016]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 12-JUL-2021 RD; annotation contributions: PMID:24248334, Miho Iijima

DDB_G0285433	Pascale Gaudet	In mammalian cells, phosducin binds to G proteins and modulate their activity. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that there are three groups of phodsucin proteins. ''Dictyostelium'', like mammalian cells and ''Drosophila'', has one member from each group: [/gene/DDB_G0292850 phlp1], [/gene/DDB_G0285433 phlp2], and [/gene/DDB_G0293848 phlp3]. Phosducins consist of an N-terminal domain containing three helices which binds the alpha subunit of G proteins, and a C-terminal domain which bears similarity to thioredoxin and binds to the beta/gamma subunit of G proteins. <br />Phlp2 lack many residues in the C-terminal region that are expected to be required for G beta/gamma binding. The cellular role of Phlp2 is unknown, but appears to be essential for growth: null mutants divide for a few generations and die. The putative ortholog from ''S. cerevisiae'', ''plp2'', is also essential ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/199357 Blaauw et al.2003]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 18-JUN-2008 PG
DDB_G0283389	Pascale Gaudet	Rhesus proteins (Rh) are glycoproteins present on the cell surface of red blood cells in mammals and are involved in ammonium ion export ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12846905 Hemker et al., 2003]). <br />''Dictyostelium'' has two genes encoding proteins with significant similarity to Rh proteins, [/gene/DDB_G0283389 rhgA] and [/gene/DDB_G0280059 rhgB]. RhgA is localized to the [/ontology/go/0000331/annotation/page/1 contractile vacuole], suggesting a role in osmoregulation. However, analysis of a null mutant has not revealed any defect is the response to osmotic stress ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11220631 Benghezal et al., 2001]).

DDB_G0277889	Karen Kestin	Ammonia signaling is essential to the developmental program of ''Dictyostelium''. It is involved in regulatingchemotaxis, the choice between slug migration and culmination, and cell-type specification via differential geneexpression. Ammonia concentrations are regulated in part by environmental factors, however, cellular processes such astransport ([/ontology/go/0008519/annotation/page/1 ammonium transmembrane transporter activity]) and metabolism can alter intracellular concentrations. In the ''Dictyostelium'' proteome,three putative ammonium transporters exist: [/gene/DDB_G0277503 amtA], [/gene/DDB_G0277889 amtB], and [/gene/DDB_G0267424 amtC]. The transcriptlevels of the three ''amt'' genes are constant throughout development, however, their spatial expression patterns, asdetermined by ''in situ'' hybridization, are both distinct and complementary. The ''amtA'' gene is generallyexpressed in the prestalk regions, although it is also found in the upper and lower cups of the sorus and in regionscontacting the substratum. The ''amtB'' transcript is observed primarily in prepore regions and in the spore region ofthe sorus, but is absent from the upper and lower cups. Expression of ''amtC'' is similar to that of ''amtB'', however, it appears transiently in the anterior tip during the first finger stage. Disruption of the ''amtC'' gene results in larger multicelluar structures and developmental arrest at the slug stage, although a smallpercentage of slugs are able to fruit after 40+ hours of starvation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14686953 Follstaedt et al.2003]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-AUG-2008 PG

DDB_G0277147	Pascale Gaudet	''stkA'' has been isolated as a "stalky" mutant, in which cells destined to become spores end up as stalk cells ([/ontology/go/0045595/annotation/page/1 regulation of cell differentiation]).The ''stkA'' gene contains GATA-binding transcription factor domains. Its transcript appears at approximately 10 hr of development and peaks at 16-18 hr, preferentially in prespore cells. The StkA protein contains two sequences necessary for localization to the [/ontology/go/0005634/annotation/page/1 nucleus] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8898200 Chang et al. 1996]). <br />Putative targets for this factor have been identified by differential display of RNA from cells of the culmination stage. In ''stkA'' null mutants, the genes [/gene/DDB_G0277835 cspA], [/gene/DDB_G0292808 cspB], [/gene/DDB_G0282293 rnpA], and [/gene/DDB_G0293364 sigB] fail to be expressed ([/ontology/go/0003700/annotation/page/1 transcription factor activity]), ([/ontology/go/0006355/annotation/page/1 regulation of transcription, DNA-dependent]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11100898 Loughran et al. 2000]). The promoters of ''sigB'' and ''culD'' are also regulated by the MADS box transcription factor [/gene/DDB_G0281387 srfA] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14665466 Escalante et al. 2003]). <br />GATA transcription factors specifically bind the DNA sequence (A/T)GATA(A/G) in the regulatory regions of genes ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2249770 Yamamoto et al. 1990]).In mammalian cells, GATA-binding transcription factors play important roles in development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12943715 Tremblay and Viger 2003]).

DDB_G0288287	Robert Dodson	''atg101'' encodes a homolog of human ATG101, a small protein that associates with ATG13 in the ATG1 complex ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20603609 Calvo-Garrido et al. 2010)]. The interaction of Dictyostelium ATG101 and ATG13 ([/gene/DDB_G0269162 atg13]) was confirmed in 2-hybrid assays. Autophagy was strongly reduced in mutant cells lacking ATG101. Strains carrying null mutations in ''atg101'' form multi-tipped aggregates that fail to make normal fruiting ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26246495 Mesquita et al. 2015)].

Pia is part of the TORC2 complex, and the HSB1 (G917A) mutation causes a temperature-sensitive abolished ACA (adenylate cyclase A; [/gene/DDB_G0281545 acaA]) activity, leading to an abolished aggregation phenotype [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12413895  (Pergolizzi et al. 2002)].<br />The ''hephA'' gene encodes a predicted ubiquitin ligase, containing a HECT and a PH domain in the C-terminal third of the protein (HectPH1). REMI mutants with insertions upstream of those domains rescued the HSB1 phenotype, spontaneous chemotaxis and development were restored. While the obvious developmental phenotypes were rescued in the HSB1/HECTPH-Ko suppressor mutant, ACA stimulation was not restored but bypassed. However, ACB, the adenylate cyclase B ([/gene/DDB_G0267376 acrA]) was shown to play an essential role in the HSB1 rescue. When the ''hephA'' gene is deleted, aggregation is delayed and development is asynchronous, while sensitivity to cAMP is increased. These results indicate that inactivating the HectPH1 ubiquitin ligase increases the cellular sensitivity to cAMP, allowing cell development in response to very low cAMP levels in the HSB1 mutant, thus suggesting that HectPH1 is involved in the desensitization of cAMP signalling [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28049717  (Pergolizzi et al. 2017)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated 21-MAR-2017 PF; annotation contributions: PMID 28049717 Barbara Pergolizzi, Salvo Bozzaro

DDB_G0291077	Robert Dodson	The ''rdiA'' gene was characterized by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12198156  Rivero et al. 2002]. Two hybrid analysis revealed that RdiA interacted with Rac1A/B/C, RacB, RacC, and RacE. A null mutant of ''rdiA'' displayed defects in both cytokinesis and pinocytosis, and slow growth rate. In addition, ''rdiA'' null cells contain large vacuoles, prominent actin-rich protrusions, and reduced actin polymerization in response to cAMP stimulation. These results indicate that ''rdiA'' plays a central role in the regulation of signal transduction cascades mediated by Rho GTPases.Basic annotations have been added to this gene, 22-OCT-2014 RD

DDB_G0292810	Robert Dodson	beta-glucosidase was one of the first developmentally regulated enzymes to be used as a stage specific marker in ''Dictyostelium''. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4982890 Coston and Loomis 1969)]. Two electrophoretically separable isozymes were found to accumulate at different stages of development. Mutations in the ''gluA'' locus affected both the early and the late isozyme that appear to differ in post-translational modifications ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/57116 Dimond and Loomis 1976)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6162850 Knecht and Dimond 1981)]. mRNA from the ''gluA'' locus is present between 2 and 6 hours of development and then remains at a low level until 16 hours when it accumulates again to reach a peak at 22 hours that is three fold higher than the early developmental peak ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8288612 Bush et al. 1976)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420 Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. The GluA protein has a signal sequence at the N-terminus for secretion followed by a stretch of 49 polar amino acids that is cleaved off to generate the mature protein. Like other acid hydrolases in growing cells, beta-glucosidase is found in lysosomes and secreted into the surrounding medium. During culmination ''gluA'' is expressed uniquely in the Pst 0 region of prestalk cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12796308 Maeda et al. 2003)]. Analyses of ''gluA'' null mutants indicate that beta-glucosidase acts as a block to selfing in macrocyst formation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/57116 Dimond and Loomis 1976)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 20-JAN-2016 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

DDB_G0277503	Pascale Gaudet	Ammonia signaling is essential to the developmental program of ''Dictyostelium''. It is involved in regulatingchemotaxis, the choice between slug migration and culmination, and cell-type specification via differential geneexpression. Ammonia concentrations are regulated in part by environmental factors, however, cellular processes such astransport ([/ontology/go/0008519/annotation/page/1 ammonium transmembrane transporter activity]) and metabolism can alter intracellular concentrations. In the ''Dictyostelium'' proteome, three putative ammonium transporters exist: [/gene/DDB_G0277503 amtA], [/gene/DDB_G0277889 amtB], and [/gene/DDB_G0267424 amtC]. The transcript levels of the three ''amt'' genes are constant throughout development, as determined by RT-PCR ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14686953 Follstaedt et al. 2003]); however, by Northern blot, another group has found the ''amtA'' gene to be strongly expressed until after the post-aggregation stage ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17951519 Yoshino et al.2007]). Discrepancies were also found in the spatial expression pattern: Follstaedt ''et al.'' localized ''amtA'' to the prestalk cells using ''in situ'' hybridization; while cell separation followed by Northern blotting showed an enrichment in prespore cells (Yoshino ''et al.''). The ''amtB'' transcript is observed primarily in prepore regions and in the spore region of the sorus, but is absent from the upper and lower cups. Expression of ''amtC'' is similar to that of '' amtB'', however, it appears transiently in the anterior tip during the first finger stage. Disruption of the '' amtC'' gene results in larger multicelluar structures and developmental arrest at the slug stage, although a small percentage of slugs are able to fruit after 40+ hours of starvation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14686953 Follstaedt et al.2003]).<br />The ''amtA'' null mutant forms small aggregates and small fruiting bodies ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14686953 Follstaedt et al.2003], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17951519 Yoshino et al.2007]). In addition, the mutant has increased intracellular ammonium levels and reduced extracellular ammonium levels, indicating a role for AmtA in ammonium export. This defect in ammonium homeostasis is also associated with decreased spore viability ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17951519 Yoshino et al. 2007]).

DDB_G0290009	CGM_DDB	Sepiapterin reductase (SR, EC: 1.1.1.153) participates in the biosynthesis of L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a co-factor for aromatic aminoacid hydroxylation, nitric oxide synthesis, and glyceryl-etherhydroxylation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10727395 Thony et al. 2000]). The first reaction in BH4 biosynthesis is catalyzed by GTP cyclohydrolase I ([/gene/DDB_G0288481 gchA]), which converts GTP to dihydroneopterin triphosphate (H2-NTP), which is transformed to 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin (PPH4) by 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) ([/gene/DDB_G0279095 ptsA]). The diketo compound is reduced further to BH4 by SR through two consecutive reductions. <br />Cells in which ''sr'' has been knocked out still produce a small amount of pteridine (L-erythro-biopterin and D-threo-biopterin), possibly through a different pathway involving aldehyde reductase ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21256841 Choi et al. 2005]). The mutant exhibits decreased growth rates, reduced spore viability, impaired mitochondrial function, and increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. The authors propose that tetrahydropterines have an antioxidant function in ''Dictyostelium'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17976377 Kim et al. 2007]).

DDB_G0272618	Robert Dodson	The superpathway of oxidative and non-oxidative branches of the pentose phosphate pathway serves as an alternative way to oxidize glucose. This pathway couples NADP in its oxidative reactions, thereby synthesizing NADPH. The net reaction for this superpathway is 3 glucose 6-P + 6 NADP<sup>+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O &lt;=&gt; 6 NADPH + 6 H<sup>+</sup> + 3 CO<sub>2</sub> + glyceraldehyde 3-P + 2 beta-D-fructose-6-P. Enzymes involved in the pentose phosphate pathway are: glucose 6-phosphate-1-dehydrogenase ([/gene/DDB_G0273131 g6pd-1]); 6-phosphogluconolactonase ([/gene/DDB_G0292898 pgl]); 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase ([/gene/DDB_G0277885 gnd]); ribose-5-phosphate isomerase ([/gene/DDB_G0276711 rpiA]); ribulose phosphate 3-epimerase ([/gene/DDB_G0278275 rpe]); transketolase ([/gene/DDB_G0272618 tkt-1]); and transaldolase ([/gene/DDB_G0280909 tal]).<br /> The autophagy-related protein kinase Atg1 ([/gene/DDB_G0292390 atg1]) was shown to interact with Tkt in a yeast two-hybrid assay. In addition, ''atg1'' null mutants reduced transketolase activity, suggesting the presence of a regulatory pathway between autophagy and the pentose phosphate pathway in ''Dictyostelium''.

DDB_G0269162	Robert Dodson	''atg13'', the Dictyostelium homolog of yeast ATG13 was found by 2-hybrid assay with the protein kinase ATG1 ([/gene/DDB_G0292390 atg1]) as bait ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26246495 Mesquita et al. 2015)]. ''atg13'' encodes an 88 kDa protein with a short N-terminus sequence with similarity to plant and fungal ATG13 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20603609 Calvo-Garrido et al. 2010)]. In addtion to ATG1, yeast 2-hybrid assays also show that ATG13 interacts with ATG101 ([/gene/DDB_G0288287 atg101]) to form the ATG1 complex that helps initiate phagophore formation. The phenotype of ''atg13'' null cells is similar to that of of ''atg1'' null cells: no measurable autophagy occurs and the cells fail to aggregate or develop ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26246495 Mesquita et al. 2015)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 08-MAR-2017 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis and Ricardo Escalante

DDB_G0271138	Pascale Gaudet	The ABC superfamily of genes is one of the largest in the genomes of both bacteria and eukaryotes. The proteins encoded by these genes all carry a characteristic 200- to 250-amino-acid ATP-binding cassette that gives them their family name ([/ontology/go/0042626/annotation/page/1 ATPase activity, coupled to transmembrane movement of substances]).

DDB_G0291994	Pascale Gaudet	The ABC superfamily of genes is one of the largest in the genomes of both bacteria and eukaryotes. The proteins encoded by these genes all carry a characteristic 200- to 250-amino-acid ATP-binding cassette that gives them their family name ([/ontology/go/0042626/annotation/page/1 ATPase activity, coupled to transmembrane movement of substances]).

DDB_G0276885	Petra Fey	CK2 (casein kinase II), a ubiquitous serine/threonine kinase, is one of the most highly conserved proteins in eukaryotic cells. The protein kinase usually forms a tetramer, comprised of two catalytic alpha or alpha' subunits, and two regulatory beta subunits. The ''Dictyostelium'' ''casK'' gene encodes a previously cloned CK2 alpha chain [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1448100  (Kikkawa et al., 1992)]. In addition, the ''Dictyostelium'' genome contains another putative alpha chain, [/gene/DDB_G0286481 DDB_G0286481], and a single ortholog of the CK2 beta chain, [/gene/DDB_G0284601 csnk2b]. <br />The CK2 alpha chain encoded by ''casK'' has been identified by PCR, based on similarity. Northern blot analysis of ''casK'' during development, as well as CK2 activity ([/ontology/go/0004682/annotation/page/1 protein kinase CK2 activity]) throughout development both show a constitutive expression and presence of CK2 during the ''Dictyostelium'' life cycle. Attempts to delete the ''casK'' gene failed, indicating that it is an essential gene [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1448100  (Kikkawa et al., 1992)]. However, in yeast, which has two CK2 genes, only (haploid) cells carrying disruptions in both CK2 alpha chains are inviable [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2196445  (Padmanabha et al., 1990)].<br />Protein kinase CK2 represents a family of closely related kinases with broad specifity. There are hundreds of target molecules, implicating CK2 in many signalling pathways ([/ontology/go/0007165/annotation/page/1 signal transduction]), including such involved in cell survival. For recent reviews see [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12396231  (Litchfield, 2003)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12631575  (Meggio &amp; Pinnal, 2003)], and [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12062170  (Ahmed et al., 2002)]. <br />The presence of a second putative CK2 alpha- and one putative CK2 beta chain in ''Dictyostelium'' suggests that the tetrameric holoenzyme in this organism consists of two different alpha chains and two identical beta chains. However, currently there is no eperimental evidence that these putative genes are expressed and further investigation is necessary.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 10-MAY-2004 PF

DDB_G0279925	Petra Fey	The ''mlkA'' gene encodes the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK-A). The MLCK-A was purified, and found to phosphorylate ([/ontology/go/0004672/annotation/page/1 protein kinase activity]) the ''Dictyostelium'' RMLC (myosin regulatory light chain, [/gene/DDB_G0276077 mlcR]) with high specificity [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3032987  (Griffith et al., 1987)]. RMLC phosphorylation occurs only on serine residues ([/ontology/go/0004674/annotation/page/1 protein serine/threonine kinase activity]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3029131  (Berlot et al., 1987)] and S13 has been identified as the phosphorylation site [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7806572  (Ostrow et al., 1994)]. <br />Despite the high sequence similarity of ''mlkA'' with calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, including myosin light chain kinases from higher eukaryotes, it was shown that there is neither a calmodulin binding domain ([/ontology/go/0005516/annotation/page/1 calmodulin binding])in the ''mlkA'' sequence, nor calcium/camodulin-dependent activation ([/ontology/go/0004685/annotation/page/1 calcium- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity]) of the kinase [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1651931  (Tan &amp; Spudich, 1991)]. In fact, in ''Dictyostelium'' whole cell lysates as well as in ammonium sulfate fractions, no calcium/calmodulin-regulated MLCK-A activity was detected [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2380188  (Tan &amp; Spudich, 1990)]. However, two activation mechanisms of the MLCK-A have been identified: autophosphorylation at T289 ([/ontology/go/0046777/annotation/page/1 protein amino acid autophosphorylation]) in the C-terminal autoinhibitory domain, and phosphorylation in the activation loop at T166 by a yet unidentified kinase [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8947030  (Smith et al., 1996a)]. Although the Dictyostelium MLCK kinase has not been identified, rat calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase can be used as a surrogate activator of MLCK-A, phosphorylating it on Thr-166 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14570871  (Tokumitsu et al., 2004)]. Residues 283-288 function as an autoinhibitory sequence, and although autoinhibition is fully relieved by T166 phosphorylation, removal of the autoinhibitory domain alone does not generate maximum enzymatic activity. Thus phosphorylation of T166 by an upstream kinase releases autoinhibition and increases the catalytic activity of the MLCK-A.<br />Early studies found that cAMP stimulation ([/ontology/go/0019933/annotation/page/1 cAMP-mediated signaling]) increases RMLC phosphorylation due to a transient activitation of the MLCK-A [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3029131  (Berlot et al., 1987)]. Liu and Newell reported that the MLCK-A in cGMP-deficient mutant strains failed to phosphorylate the RMLC in response to cAMP, implicating cGMP in the regulation of MLCK-A activity [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7983143  (Liu &amp; Newell, 1996)]. More recently it was shown that MLCK-A activation through T166 phosphorylation is indirectly activated by cGMP ([/ontology/go/0019934/annotation/page/1 cGMP-mediated signaling]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9789030  (Silveira et al., 1998)].<br />A ''mlkA''-null mutant was generated, and, grown in suspension, showed a slight cytokinesis defect ([/ontology/go/0000910/annotation/page/1 cytokinesis]). The defect became more severe when cells were grown with heat-killed bacteria. However, the cytokinesis inefficiency is mild in comparison to [/gene/DDB_G0276077 mlcR] and [/gene/DDB_G0286355 mhcA] mutants. Also, different from those mutants, ''mlkA''-null cells were able to complete development. Because there is still phosphorylated RMLC present in ''mlkA''-null mutants, it has been suggested that there is at least one more kinase that phosphorylates the RMLC [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8901579  (Smith et al., 1996b)]. However, it has been shown that MLCK-A is the only kinase that is responsible for RMLC phosphorylation during chemotaxis ([/ontology/go/0050920/annotation/page/1 regulation of chemotaxis]), and that this process is activated by cGMP and [/gene/DDB_G0291079 gbpC] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16546177  (Goldberg et al., 2006)].<br />MLCK-A is in the CAMK group of the protein kinase superfamily. It is 48-51% identical to four other putative ''Dictyostelium'' CAM kinases ([/gene/DDB_G0275057 DDB_G0275057], [/gene/DDB_G0271550 DDB_G0271550], [/gene/DDB_G0282429 DDB_G0282429], [/gene/DDB_G0292624 DDB_G0292624]). However, it is not known whether one or more of these kinases represents other MLCK(s), or if the other ''Dictyostelium'' MLCK enzyme(s) are more distantly related.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 09-FEB-2006 PF

DDB_G0292758	Petra Fey	Mob1 was originally identified in ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' as a binder of [/gene/DDB_G0280995 mps1], a kinase involved in mitotic regulation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9436989 Luca and Winey 1998]). Mob1 serves as a substrate for Mps1 and functions to regulate the NDR kinases (nuclear Dbf2-related, [/gene/DDB_G0278457 ndrA], [/gene/DDB_G0288753 ndrB], [/gene/DDB_G0284839 ndrC], and [/gene/DDB_G0289543 ndrD]) in mammals, which are involved in cell proliferation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15067004 Devroe et al.2004]).

DDB_G0278457	Petra Fey	The AGC family of serine/threonine protein kinases derives its name from the founding members: PKA (protein kinase A/cAMP-dependent protein kinase), PKG (protein kinase G), and PKC (protein kinase C). Other subfamilies exist within the AGC group, including Akt/PKB, NDR (nuclear Dbf2-related), PDK (phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase), and RSK (ribosomal S6kinase). <br />There are 20 AGC family kinases in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome, among those are 4 NDR group kinases, two NDR-like kinases, [/gene/DDB_G0278457 ndrA], [/gene/DDB_G0288753 ndrB], and two LATS-related kinases [/gene/DDB_G0284839 ndrC], [/gene/DDB_G0289543 ndrD]. NdrA has been shown to be involved in phagocytosis, especially during the engulfment step. The protein localizes to the centrosome and during prometaphase to the spindle. In addition, several proteins have been identified to bind to NdrA: [/gene/DDB_G0278969 empC],[/gene/DDB_G0278907 mobA], and [/gene/DDB_G0292758 mobB] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21134080  (Kastner et al. 2011)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 14-JUN-2012 PF

DDB_G0269150	Pascale Gaudet	''lvsA'' was isolated as a mutant that has a large volume sphere phenotype. ''lvsA''- cells have a [/ontology/go/0000910/annotation/page/1 cytokinesis] defect similar to that of ''Dictyostelium'' clathrin heavy-chain mutants ([/gene/DDB_G0277221 chcA]) but less pronounced defects in[/ontology/go/0006907/annotation/page/1 pinocytosis] and [/ontology/go/0006909/annotation/page/1 phagocytosis].In addition, ''lvsA'' null mutant has defects in [/ontology/go/0007032/annotation/page/1 endosome organization], as does [/gene/DDB_G0271504 lvsB] null mutant ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10588668 Kwak et al. 1999], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11865029 Cornillon et al. 2002]). Localization studies have shown that GFP-LvsA is primarily associated with the membranes of the contractile vacuole system and that it has a punctate distribution in the cytoplasm. In ''lvsA'' mutants the contractile vacuole becomes disorganized and calmodulin ([/gene/DDB_G0279407 calA]) dissociates from the contractile vacuole membranes. Consequently, ''lvsA-'' mutants have an aberrant [/ontology/go/0006971/annotation/page/1 hypotonic response] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11872142 (Gerald et al. 2002)]. A truncated version of LvsA missing the 689 N-terminal amino acids rescues cytokinesis defects and partially rescues defects in osmoregulation of ''lvsA''- mutant. Further deletions resulted in the complete loss of LvsA function. The association of LvsA with the contractile vacuole is perturbed by the loss of [/gene/DDB_G0269130 phgA], a protein important for vacuole function. The exact function of LvsA is not known, but it has been shown to bind membranes ([/ontology/go/0005543/annotation/page/1 phospholipid binding])in a GTP-independent manner ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15086784 Wu et al. 2004]). <br />A double mutant in [/gene/DDB_G0280955 DDB_G0280955] and ''lvsA'' suppresses the large contractile vacuole phenotype of disgorgin-, while overexpression of GFP-lvsA enhances it, suggesting ''lvsA'' is involved in the organization of the contractile vacuole ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18636095 Du et al. 2008]). <br />Seven BEACH domain-containing proteins have been identified in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome: [/gene/DDB_G0269150 lvsA], [/gene/DDB_G0271504 lvsB], [/gene/DDB_G0280971 lvsC], [/gene/DDB_G0271502 lvsD], [/gene/DDB_G0282925 lvsE], [/gene/DDB_G0284333 lvsF], and [/gene/DDB_G0268088 lvsG].

DDB_G0271502	Pascale Gaudet	Seven BEACH domain-containing proteins have been identified in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome: [/gene/DDB_G0269150 lvsA], [/gene/DDB_G0271504 lvsB], [/gene/DDB_G0280971 lvsC], [/gene/DDB_G0271502 lvsD], [/gene/DDB_G0282925 lvsE], [/gene/DDB_G0284333 lvsF], and [/gene/DDB_G0268088 lvsG]. <br />Disruption mutants were created in ''lvsA-F''. Phenotypic analyses of these mutants indicate LvsC-F proteins are not required for cytokinesis, osmoregulation (contrary to [/gene/DDB_G0269150 lvsA]), lysosomal traffic (unlike [/gene/DDB_G0271504 lvsB]) or other processes such as growth and development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3308452 Wang et al. 2002]). Howver, data from highthroughput analysis of mutants indicates that inertions in the ''lvsD'' gene causes aberrant cAMP wave formation, aberrant culmination, and aberrant vegetative growth ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17659086 Sawai et al. 2007])<br />A double mutant in [/gene/DDB_G0280955 DDB_G0280955] and ''lvsD'' enhances the large contractile vacuole phenotype of disgorgin-; whereas overexpression of GFP-lvsD suppresses it, suggesting ''lvsD'' is involved in the organization of the contractile vacuole. Since LvsD is cytosolic, it is possible that it interacts with [/gene/DDB_G0269150 lvsA] to inhibit its role in contractile vacuole organization([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18636095 Du et al. 2008]).

DDB_G0279343	Karen Kestin	The Aurora family of serine/threonine protein kinases ([/ontology/go/0004674/annotation/page/1 protein serine/threonine kinase activity]) were originally identified in ''Drosophila melanogaster''mutants defective in spindle-pole behavior. The name "Aurora" stems from the auroraphenomenon observed in the night sky over the polar regions. Both Aurora A and Aurora B kinases have been found in metazoans, while only one Aurora kinase has been identified in ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'', ''Schizosaccharomyces pombe'' and ''Dictyostelium discoideum''. Aurora A kinases associate with the centrosome during mitosis and have been shown to be involved in proper centrosome positioning and spindle assembly. Aurora B kinases are localized to the equator of the mitotic spindle and are thought to play a role in kinetochore attachment to the microtubule spindle and other important events in mitosis. <br />The ''Dictyostelium'' Aurora kinase has been shown to have properties of both Aurora A and Aurora B kinases. Like Aurora A, it localizes at to the [/ontology/go/0000922/annotation/page/1 spindle pole]s in early mitosis. Like Aurora B, it binds to [/gene/DDB_G0267690 icpA] (DdINCENP) and localizes to the [/ontology/go/0005813/annotation/page/1 centrosome], the [/ontology/go/0051233/annotation/page/1 spindle midzone], and the late [/ontology/go/0032154/annotation/page/1 cleavage furrow] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18326585 Li et al., 2008]).This gene has been comprehensively annotated, 12-NOV-2008 PF

DDB_G0282375	Pascale Gaudet	''amiB'' (aggregation minus B), was isolated as a REMI mutant that does not aggregate upon starvation ([/ontology/go/0031152/annotation/page/1 aggregation involved in sorocarp development]). ''amiB'' encodes the putative ortholog ofthe mediator complex subunit 13 med13 transcriptional co-activator involved in ([/ontology/go/0006367/annotation/page/1 transcription initiation from RNA polymerase II promoter]). When starved, ''amiB''- cells fails to produce cAMP. Moreover, ''amiB''- cells do not turn off the expression of one of the growth-phase genes, [/gene/DDB_G0278721 cprD], and fail to turn on the expression of [/gene/DDB_G0281545 acaA] following starvation. The ectopic expression of [/gene/DDB_G0281545 acaA], [/gene/DDB_G0275445 mybB] or [/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC] rescues the developmental defect of the ''amiB''- mutant. AmiB is thought to play a role early in development by stimulating [/gene/DDB_G0281545 acaA] expression which is essential for cAMP signaling ([/ontology/go/0007242/annotation/page/1 intracellular signaling cascade]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10651904 Kon et al. 2000]).<br />''amiB''- cells have aberrant morphology when placed in starvation buffer: rather than forming pseudopods, they form larger locomotory structures ressembling lamellipodia of fish keratocytes. The distribution of actin, [/gene/DDB_G0272106 arpB], and [/gene/DDB_G0286355 mhcA] in ''amiB''- mutant is similar to that observed in fish keratocytes. These results suggest that AmiB is important for [/ontology/go/0006935/annotation/page/1 chemotaxis] and [/ontology/go/0006928/annotation/page/1 cell motion] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15259052 Asano et al. 2004]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 02-DEC-2008 PG

Three distinct zinc-containing RNA polymerases are found in eukaryotic nuclei: [/gene/DDB0216292 DDB0216292] for the ribosomal RNA precursor ([/ontology/go/0006360/annotation/page/1 transcription from RNA polymerase I promoter]), ([/ontology/go/0005736/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase I complex]), [/gene/DDB0215406 DDB0215406] for the mRNA precursor ([/ontology/go/0006366/annotation/page/1 transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter]), ([/ontology/go/0005665/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase II, core complex]), and [/gene/DDB0215406 DDB0215406] for 5S and tRNA genes ([/ontology/go/0006383/annotation/page/1 transcription from RNA polymerase III promoter]), ([/ontology/go/0005666/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase III complex]).<br />RNA polymerase II is composed of 12 subunits: [/gene/DDB0215406 DDB0215406], [/gene/DDB0187850 DDB0187850], [/gene/DDB0216289 DDB0216289], [/gene/DDB0204958 DDB0204958], [/gene/DDB0215452 DDB0215452], [/gene/DDB0219633 DDB0219633], [/gene/DDB0216295 DDB0216295], [/gene/DDB0204381 DDB0204381], [/gene/DDB0202109 DDB0202109], [/gene/DDB0216949 DDB0216949], [/gene/DDB0218015 DDB0218015], and[/gene/DDB0216300 DDB0216300]. Subunits 5, 6, 8, 10, and 12 are common to all threeRNA polymerases (reviewed by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9618449 Hampsey] in 1998). <br />Expression of ''rbp4'' in ''Dictyostelium'' is developmentally regulated, with highest expression at the loose aggregate stage. In vegetative cells and early developing cells, two transcripts are detected, while only the largest form of the transcript is found at later stages. In late development, the ''rbp4'' transcript is found in prespore cells. The Rpb4 protein is found both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. Attempts to knock out ''rbp4'' have been unsuccessful ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18992223 Naorem and Sadhale 2008]). Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 17-NOV-2008 PG

DDB_G0275617	Pascale Gaudet	The TATA binding protein (TBP) binds TATA elements located upstream of the transcription initiation site. In general, TBP is a known TFIID subunit, the large (~750-kDa) multisubunit complex composed of TBP and TBP-associated factors (TAFs). It is a universal transcription factor, required for initiation by all three eukaryotic RNA polymerases: [/gene/DDB_G0288449 rpc2], [/gene/DDB_G0288257 rpb2],and [/gene/DDB_G0293560 rpa2]. TBP-TATA association nucleates the assembly of the transcription pre-initiation complex. The crystal structure of Arabidopsis TBP revealed a remarkable structure containing a new DNA binding fold, resembling a molecular "saddle" that sits astride the DNA (reviewed by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9618449 Hampsey] in 1998).<br />''D. discoideum'' TBP has been shown to be a component of TFIIIB, which includes [/gene/DDB_G0281215 brf1] and [/gene/DDB_G0283405 bdp1]. The protein also interacts with the ORF1 proteins of non LTR retrotransposons TRE5-A and TRE5-B, which both integrate upstream of tRNAs. The TBP structure has been determined and was found to be very similar to human TBP, and brf1 and ORF1 binding sites have been mapped ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21900496  (Chung et al. 2007)]).

DDB_G0291362	Pascale Gaudet	DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates ([/ontology/go/0003899/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase activity]). Three distinct zinc-containing RNA polymerases are found in eukaryotic nuclei: [/gene/DDB_G0275759 rpa1] for the ribosomal RNA precursor ([/ontology/go/0006360/annotation/page/1 transcription from RNA polymerase I promoter]), ([/ontology/go/0005736/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase I complex]), [/gene/DDB_G0279193 rpb1] for the mRNA precursor ([/ontology/go/0006366/annotation/page/1 transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter]), ([/ontology/go/0005665/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase II, core complex]), and [/gene/DDB_G0277199 rpc1] for 5S and tRNA genes ([/ontology/go/0006383/annotation/page/1 transcription from RNA polymerase III promoter]), ([/ontology/go/0005666/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase III complex]).<br />RNA polymerase I is a multisubunit complex. The subunits encoded by [/gene/DDB_G0275759 rpa1] (ortholog of ''S. cerevisiae RPA190''), [/gene/DDB_G0288449 rpc2] (''RPA135''), [/gene/DDB_G0268198 rpa43] (''RPA43''), [/gene/DDB_G0290909 rpa49] (''RPA49''), and [/gene/DDB_G0278263 rpa12] (''RPA12'') are unique to RNA polymerase I. Two subunits, [/gene/DDB_G0291362 rpc19] and [/gene/DDB_G0282339 rpa5] (''RPC19'' and ''RPC40'' in ''S. cerevisiae''), are common to RNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase III and correspond to subunits 3 and 11 of RNA polymerase II. Subunits [/gene/DDB_G0291636 rpb5], [/gene/DDB_G0291037 rpb6], [/gene/DDB_G0278039 rpb8], [/gene/DDB_G0272036 rpb10], and [/gene/DDB_G0283365 rpb12] are common to all three RNA polymerases.

DDB_G0293850	Pascale Gaudet	The size of ''Dictyostelium'' fruiting bodies is controlled at least in part by a secreted counting factor (CF), a multisubunit complex. The role of CF in size regulation has not yet been elucidated, although a negative effect on cytosolic glucose levels has been observed. <br />NADPH-coupled aldehyde reductase reduces a wide variety of aldehydes to the corresponding alcohols, including converting glucose to sorbitol ([/ontology/go/0042593/annotation/page/1 glucose homeostasis]). The levels of this enzyme appears to be regulated by CF. Cells in which the ''alrA'' gene, encoding aldehyde reductase ([/ontology/go/0004032/annotation/page/1 aldehyde reductase activity]), has been disrupted, form aggregates much larger than wild type cells ([/ontology/go/0031158/annotation/page/1 negative regulation of aggregate size involved in sorocarp development]). ''alrA''- cells have reduced [/ontology/go/0006928/annotation/page/1 cell motion]. ''alrA''- cells secrete reduced levels of [/gene/DDB_G0274597 ctnA] and [/gene/DDB_G0273175 cf50-1], two components of CF. This could explain why ''alrA''- cells form large groups ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14551196 Ehrenman et al. 2004]).<br />''alrA'' is highly upregulated by glutathione (GSH) depletion. The enzyme glutamate-cysteine ligase, encoded by [/gene/DDB_G0284651 gcsA], catalyzes the the first and limiting step in GSH biosynthesis. Null mutants in ''gcsA'' have an absolute requirement for exogenous GSH. ''alrA'' overexpression protects [/gene/DDB_G0284651 gcsA] null mutants from GSH depletion, while underexpression makes the cells more sensitive. ''alrA'' also protects from the toxic by-product of glycolysis methylglyoxal, by breaking it down to non-toxic lactic acid using GSH as a co-factor ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18990192 Choi et al. 2008]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 22-JAN-2009 PG

If no reorientation occurs within 30 seconds of the extension, the pseudopod is retracted. Centrosomes appear to stabilize the direction of movement rather than establishing where the cell will go. The morphological changes in centrosomes were followed through the cell cycle by labelling the organelle with GFP fused to gamma- ??-tubulin (Ueda, Schliwa and Euteneuer, 1999 9880333). About 100 different proteins contribute to centrosomal functions including the products of ''tubC'', ([/gene/DDB_G0285849 spc97]), ([/gene/DDB_G0283909 spc98]), ([/gene/DDB_G0288427 cenA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0288375 lis1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0270814 nek2]), ([/gene/DDB_G0283607 eb1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0268616 cepJ]), ([/gene/DDB_G0278809 cepG]). [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15548420  (Graf et al. 2004)]. The abundance of ''tubC'' mRNA is less than 2% that of tubA mRNA in growing cells but increases rapidly between 10 and 14 hours of development, mostly in prestalk cells [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)].

About 100 different proteins contribute to centrosomal functions including the products of ''tubC'', ([/gene/DDB_G0285849 spc97]), ([/gene/DDB_G0283909 spc98]), ([/gene/DDB_G0288427 cenA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0288375 lis1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0270814 nek2]), ([/gene/DDB_G0283607 eb1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0268616 cepJ]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0278809 cepG]). [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15548420  (Graf et al. 2004)]. The abundance of ''tubC'' mRNA is less than 2% that of tubA mRNA in growing cells but increases rapidly between 10 and 14 hours of development, mostly in prestalk cells [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. ''tubC'' may have a critical role during culmination.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 17-NOV-2017 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0277863	Robert Dodson	The inhibitor of extracellular cAMP phosphodiesterase PdsA ([/gene/DDB_G0285995 pdsA]), PdiA, is synthesized during early development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2169446 Wu and Franke, 1990)]. This small 26 kDa protein binds to PdsA and reduces its affinity for cAMP about a thousand fold ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/230476 Kessin et al. 1979)]. mRNA from ''pdiA'' accumulates to a peak at 2 hours and disappears by 6 hours before reaccumulating to a second peak at 11 hours ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420 Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. Addition of cAMP between 2 and 6 hours repressed the second peak ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7851634 Wu et al. 1995)]. ''pdiA'' null cells fail to develop spiral cAMP waves, and aggregation territories and fruiting bodies are much smaller and more numerous than in wt ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9391092 Palsson et al. 1997)]. Both caffeine and adenosine rescued the ''pdiA'' null phenotype and induced formation of larger aggregates ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22269093 Jaiswal et al. 2012)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 01-DEC-2017 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

DDB_G0287587	Robert Dodson	Starved Dictyostelium cells aggregate into groups of roughly 10(5) cells. Cells in which the ''smlA'' gene is disrupted form small aggregates. The ''smlA'' mRNA is expressed in vegetative and early developing cells, and decreases at about 10 hours of development. The sequence of the cDNA and the derived amino acid sequence of the SmlA protein show no significant similarity to any known sequence. Immunofluorescence and staining of Western blots of cell fractions indicates that SmlA is a 35x10(3) Mr cytosolic protein present in all vegetative and developing cells and is absent from ''smlA''- cells. The absence of SmlA does not affect the growth rate, cell cycle, differentiation, or developmental speed of cells. Synergy experiments indicate that mixing 5% smlA cells with wild-type cells will cause the wild-type cells to form smaller fruiting bodies and aggregates. SmlA appears to regulate the secretion or processing of a secreted factor that regulates aggregate size, counting factor (CF) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8787732 (Brock et al.1996)]. Compared with wild-type or [/gene/DDB_G0274597 ctnA] countin cells, ''smlA''- cells have large cAMP pulses and small cGMP pulses [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11371560 (Tang et al.2001)]. ''smlA'' null cells have decreased adhesion, increased motility, increased amounts of polymerized actin and the ABP-120 actin-crosslinking protein, as well as increased phosphorylation and redistribution of myosin ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11090633 Roisin-Bouffay et al.2002], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11818526 Tang et al.2002]). The presence of adenosine rescued the ''smlA'' null decreased aggregate size phenotype and induced formation of larger aggregates ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22269093 Jaiswal et al. 2012)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 23-OCT-2003 PG

DDB_G0291970	Petra Fey	''Dictyostelium'' cofilin was identified through a search for actin monomer binding proteins ([/ontology/go/0003785/annotation/page/1 actin monomer binding]) in whole cell lysates. A 15 kDa protein was isolated and purified, which was shown to depolimerize actin filaments ([/ontology/go/0030042/annotation/page/1 actin filament depolymerization]) in a dose-dependent manner and to decrease the viscosity of actin filaments. This activity was inhibited by phosphatidylinositides. Cloning the cofilin gene resulted in the identification of 2 identical genes, [/gene/DDB_G0277833 cofA] and ''cofB'' that differed only in their intron and promoter sequence. When promoter activities were tested, only ''cofA'' was found to be expressed, predominantly in vegetative cells. No promoter activity was detected for ''cofB'', suggesting that ''cofB'' might be a pseudogene. This data is in conflict with the fact that several ESTs have been detected for this gene. Attempts to delete the ''cofA'' gene failed, while deletion of ''cofB'' yielded mutants with no detectable phenotype. This confirmed that ''cofB'' is not expressed and suggested that ''cofA'' is an essential gene [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7738034  (Aizawa et al., 1995) ]. <br />Overexpression of ''cofA'' was shown to stimulate bundling of actin filaments ([/ontology/go/0051017/annotation/page/1 actin filament bundle formation]) in alpha-actinin ([/gene/DDB_G0268632 abpA]) -induced actin latticeworks, probably by severing the filaments [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8636212  (Aizawa et al., 1996) ]. In overexpressing cells also showed that cofilin, together with the actin-interacting protein [/gene/DDB_G0278733 DAip1], plays a pivotal role in reorganizing the actin bundles in response to hyperosmotic stress ([/ontology/go/0006972/annotation/page/1 hyperosmotic response]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10421841  (Aizawa et al., 1999) ]. To investigate the actin depolimerization activity of cofilin further, Ichetovkin ''et al.'' showed, by two independent methods, that both native and recombinant cofilin sever actin filaments ([/ontology/go/0006972/annotation/page/1 hyperosmotic response]), but to different extents [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10744862  (Ichetovkin et al., 2000) ].<br />Recently, cofilin was found to be dependent on the MADS box transcription factor [/gene/DDB_G0281387 srfA]. The authors found an expression profile of cofilin that differed from that published for ''cofA''. While ''cofA'' expression was originally tested by promoter activity and later confirmed by western blot, this analysis was done by Northern blot. As a consequence of the discrepancy the authors referred in their paper not to cofilin A ([/gene/DDB_G0277833 cofA]), but to the identical cofilin B [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15075287  (Escalante et al., 2004) ].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 21-MAY-2004 PF

The subunits encoded by [/gene/DDB_G0277199 rpc1] (ortholog of ''S. cerevisiae RPO31''), [/gene/DDB_G0293560 rpa2] (''RPC2''), [/gene/DDB_G0268080 rpc3] (''RPC82''),[/gene/DDB_G0277671 rpc4] (''RPC53''), [/gene/DDB_G0271514 rpc5] (''RPC37''), [/gene/DDB_G0286521 rpc9] (''RPC17''), [/gene/DDB_G0272022 rpc34] (''RPC34''), [/gene/DDB_G0273425 rpc25-1] (''RPC25''), and [/gene/DDB_G0287707 rpc11] (''RPC11'') are unique to RNA polymerase III. Orthologs of ''RPC31'' and ''RPC17'' have not been identified in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome. Two subunits, [/gene/DDB_G0291362 rpc19] and [/gene/DDB_G0282339 rpa5] (''RPC19'' and ''RPC40'' in ''S. cerevisiae''), are common to RNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase III and correspond to subunits 3 and 11 of RNA polymerase II.

DDB_G0275815	Robert Dodson	The ''nramp2'' gene has been characterized by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22992462  (Bozarro et al. 2013)] and found to localize exclusively to the contractile vacuole membrane. Knockout of the ''nramp2'' gene leads to an increased infection rate by Legionella pneumophila, while nramp2/nramp1 double knockout strains display aggregation defects. Single and double mutants display differential sensitivity to cell growth under conditions of iron overload or depletion, suggesting that Nramp1 and Nramp2 act synergistically to regulate iron homeostasis.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 25-JUL-2013 RD; annotation contributions PMID:22992462 Salvatore Bozzaro

DDB_G0291117	Robert Dodson	NoxA ([/gene/DDB_G0289653 noxA]), NoxB ([/gene/DDB_G0287101 noxB]) and NoxC are homologs of the heme-containing subunit of NADPH oxidase flavocytochromes that generate superoxide for defense and signaling. Each of them has 6 predicted transmembrane regions and uses 4 histidine moieties to bind 2 heme groups. Mutations that inactivate the ''nox'' genes in the genetic background of strain JH10 result in a developmental block at the tipped mound stage, but have no effect on growth in association with bacteria. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15950752  (Lardy et al. 2005)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16367873  (Benghezal et al. 2006)]. A triple mutant in which ''noxA'', ''noxB'', and ''noxC'' are disrupted in the genetic background of strain AX2 develops normally, but has defects in the defense response to bacteria. The Sentinel cells that normally provide innate immunity in slugs are unable to generate superoxide when all 3 of the ''nox'' genes are deleted. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) stimulate S cells to take up bacteria by phagocytosis and to release mitochondrial DNA nets that trap extracellular bacteria. ''noxA''/''noxB''/''noxC'' triple null mutants release very few DNA nets and fail to clear bacteria from the slugs. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26927887  (Zhang et al. 2016)]. ''noxA'' is expressed at high levels in vegetative cells and at lower levels during development. ''noxB'' and ''noxC'' are only expressed after 6 hrs of development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15950752  (Lardy et al. 2005)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 21-DEC-2018 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

DDB_G0275687	Pascale Gaudet	[/gene/DDB_G0275689 abcG2] and ''abcG18'' are present in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome as a tandem. In insertional mutant that disrupts both [/gene/DDB_G0275689 abcG2] and ''abcG18'' (''mdrA1/mdrA2'') results in release from the developmental block and the suppression of the defect in initial cell type choice caused by loss of the [/gene/DDB_G0271916 rtoA] gene. AbcG2 is localized to the endosome. ''abcG2-/abcG18-'' cells have an endocytosis rate roughly 70% that of wild-type ([/ontology/go/0006897/annotation/page/1 endocytosis]). The triple null ''abcG2-/abcG18-/rtoA-'' has even lower endocytosis rates, about 20% that of wild type cells. The exocytosis rates of ''abcG2-/abcG18-''and ''abcG2-/abcG18-/rtoA-'' are roughly that of wild-type. ''abcG2-/[/gene/DDB_G0275687 abcG18]-'' endosomes have an unusually high pH ([/ontology/go/0030641/annotation/page/1 regulation of cellular pH]), whereas ''abcG2-/abcG18-/rtoA-'' endosomes have an almost normal pH [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11719559  (Brazill et al. 2000)].<br />The ABC superfamily of genes is one of the largest in the genomes of both bacteria and eukaryotes. The proteins encoded by these genes all carry a characteristic 200- to 250-amino-acid ATP-binding cassette that gives them their family name ([/ontology/go/0042626/annotation/page/1 ATPase activity, coupled to transmembrane movement of substances]). In bacteria they are mostly involved in nutrient import, while in eukaryotes many are involved in export([/ontology/go/0006810/annotation/page/1 transport]). Seven different families have been defined in eukaryotes based on sequence homology, domain topology, and function. Sequences from the well-advanced ''Dictyostelium'' genome project have allowed to recognize 71 ABC transporters (including one on the chromosome 2 duplication) of this superfamily. The ABCG family is characterized by the ABC domain preceding the transmembrane domain([/ontology/go/0016021/annotation/page/1 integral to membrane]). All of the members of this family in animals are half-transporters while all of the fungal members are full transporters with two ABC-transmembrane units. No members of this family are found in bacteria. ''Dictyostelium'' and ''Arabidopsis'' have members of both types[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12456012  (Anjard and Loomis 2002)].

DDB_G0267436	Pascale Gaudet	The ABC superfamily of genes is one of the largest in the genomes of both bacteria and eukaryotes. The proteins encoded by these genes all carry a characteristic 200- to 250-amino-acid ATP-binding cassette that gives them their family name. In bacteria they are mostly involved in nutrient import, while in eukaryotes many are involved in export. Seven different families (A to G) have been defined in eukaryotes based on sequence homology, domain topology, and function. ''Dictyostelium'' has 71 ABC transporters (including one on the chromosome 2 duplication) and 4 ABCF family members: [/gene/DDB_G0285997 abcF1], [/gene/DDB_G0284047 abcF2], [/gene/DDB_G0275637 abcF3] and [/gene/DDB_G0267436 abcF4]. The ABCF family is characterized by two ABC domains and no transmembrane domains. [/gene/DDB_G0285997 abcF1] and [/gene/DDB_G0267436 abcF4] are the most closely related to GCN20 from yeast and so are candidates for translational regulators [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6420574 (Anjard and Loomis 2002)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 16-JUN-2003 PG

DDB_G0293002	Pascale Gaudet	''tagA'' is expressed at the onset of development and is required for the differentiation of a subpopulation of prespore cells. Wild-type cells express ''tagA'' in prespore cells and in mature spores. TagA appears to be required for the specification of an initial population of prespore cells in which tagA is expressed ([/ontology/go/0030154/annotation/page/1 cell differentiation]). ''tagA'' mutants elaborate multiple prestalk cell regions during development and produce spores asynchronously and with low viability. TagA appears to play a general role in [/ontology/go/0045595/annotation/page/1 regulation of cell differentiation] since ''tagA'' mutants express a spore coat protein gene, [/gene/DDB_G0276761 cotB], within vacuolated cells that form part of the stalk and they express a prestalk/stalk-specific gene, [/gene/DDB_G0269132 ecmB], within cells that become spores[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12756178  (Good et al. 2003)]. <br />ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are [/ontology/go/0016021/annotation/page/1 integral to membrane] proteins involved [/ontology/go/0006810/annotation/page/1 transport] ([/ontology/go/0042626/annotation/page/1 ATPase activity, coupled to transmembrane movement of substances]). ''Dictyostelium'' has 71 ABC transporters (including one on the chromosome 2 duplication). [/gene/DDB_G0293002 tagA], [/gene/DDB_G0286119 tagB], [/gene/DDB_G0286121 tagC], and [/gene/DDB_G0286123 tagD] are members of the B family of ABC transporters. These four genes have a similar structure, with a serine protease domain ([/ontology/go/0008236/annotation/page/1 serine-type peptidase activity]) N-terminal of the half-transporter, a domain organization unique to ''Dictyostelium''. ''tagA'' is located on chromosome 6, while the ''tagB'', ''tagC'' and ''tagD'' genes are located next to each other on chromosome 4 and appear to have arisen by tandem duplications. They encode proteins that are more than 65% identical, with the differences located mostly in the terminal regions. In the central region, their nucleotide sequences are more than 95% identical([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12456012 Loomis and Anjard 2002]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 16-JUN-2003 PG

DDB_G0288061	CGM_DDB	Using an apoaequorin expressing strain, Ludlow ''et al.'' showed that ''Dictyostelium'' posseses P2X receptors that facilitate rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in response to extracellular ATP and ADP. Deleting [/gene/DDB_G0272004 p2xA] or [/gene/DDB_G0288061 p2xE] did not influence this behavior, suggesting these genes are not involved. However, this study proposes possible roles for [/gene/DDB_G0275293 p2xB], [/gene/DDB_G0275191 p2xC], or [/gene/DDB_G0288335 p2xD] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18486207  (Ludlow et al. 2008)].<br />Most recently, Ludlow ''et al.'' showed that p2xB and p2xE, as well as p2xA, have ATP-gated channel activity when expressed in ''Xenopus'' oocytes. However, Na<sup>+</sup> rather inhibited this activity to various degrees in these P2x channels, but K<sup>+</sup>, and NH4<sup>+</sup> ions elicited a large response. Interestingly, p2xA and p2xB, but not p2xE are permeable to Cl<sup>-</sup> ions. No such ATP-gated channel activity was found for p2xC and p2xD. All ''Dictyostelium'' P2x proteins localize to the [/ontology/go/0031164/annotation/page/1 contractile vacuolar membrane], and not to the plasma membrane like P2X receptors from other organisms. By using a protease protection assay on tagged receptors the authors demonstrated that the transmembrane loop region containing the agonist (ATP) binding site lies within the lumen of the vacuole. A quintuple p2xA/B/C/D/E null mutant in wild type background AX2 shows a reduced response to the calmodulin inhibitor calmidazolium, suggesting a role of the ''Dictyostelium'' proteins in the [/ontology/go/0050848/annotation/page/1 regulation of calcium-mediated signaling]. The quintuple null mutant also shows a slight delay in its [/ontology/go/0006971/annotation/page/1 hypotonic response] when placed in water, however, single mutants in a AX2 background do not show any osmoregulatory defect. Taken together, this study suggests that it is still unclear which molecules are responsible for the extracellular purinergic response in ''Dictyostelium'' and it raises the possibility that the P2x receptors may play a role in the release of intracellular Ca <sup>2+</sup> stores in response to an ATP stimulus from within the contractile vacuole [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19833731  (Ludlow et al. 2009)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 11-MAR-2010 PF

DDB_G0288335	CGM_DDB	Using an apoaequorin expressing strain, Ludlow ''et al.'' showed that ''Dictyostelium'' posseses P2X receptors that facilitate rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in response to extracellular ATP and ADP. Deleting [/gene/DDB_G0272004 p2xA] or [/gene/DDB_G0288061 p2xE] did not influence this behavior, suggesting these genes are not involved. However, this study proposes possible roles for [/gene/DDB_G0275293 p2xB], [/gene/DDB_G0275191 p2xC], or [/gene/DDB_G0288335 p2xD] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18486207  (Ludlow et al. 2008)].<br />Most recently, Ludlow ''et al.'' showed that p2xB and p2xE, as well as p2xA, have ATP-gated channel activity when expressed in ''Xenopus'' oocytes. However, Na<sup>+</sup> rather inhibited this activity to various degrees in these P2x channels, but K<sup>+</sup>, and NH4<sup>+</sup> ions elicited a large response. Interestingly, p2xA and p2xB, but not p2xE are permeable to Cl<sup>-</sup> ions. No such ATP-gated channel activity was found for p2xC and p2xD. All ''Dictyostelium'' P2x proteins localize to the [/ontology/go/0031164/annotation/page/1 contractile vacuolar membrane], and not to the plasma membrane like P2X receptors from other organisms. By using a protease protection assay on tagged receptors the authors demonstrated that the transmembrane loop region containing the agonist (ATP) binding site lies within the lumen of the vacuole. A quintuple p2xA/B/C/D/E null mutant in wild type background AX2 shows a reduced response to the calmodulin inhibitor calmidazolium, suggesting a role of the ''Dictyostelium'' proteins in the [/ontology/go/0050848/annotation/page/1 regulation of calcium-mediated signaling]. The quintuple null mutant also shows a slight delay in its [/ontology/go/0006971/annotation/page/1 hypotonic response] when placed in water, however, single mutants in a AX2 background do not show any osmoregulatory defect. Taken together, this study suggests that it is still unclear which molecules are responsible for the extracellular purinergic response in ''Dictyostelium'' and it raises the possibility that the P2x receptors may play a role in the release of intracellular Ca <sup>2+</sup> stores in response to an ATP stimulus from within the contractile vacuole [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19833731  (Ludlow et al. 2009)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 11-MAR-2010 PF

DDB_G0280541	Pascale Gaudet	The ABC superfamily of genes is one of the largest in the genomes of both bacteria and eukaryotes. The proteins encoded by these genes all carry a characteristic 200- to 250-amino-acid ATP-binding cassette that gives them their family name ([/ontology/go/0042626/annotation/page/1 ATPase activity, coupled to transmembrane movement of substances]). In bacteria they are mostly involved in nutrient import, while in eukaryotes many are involved in export([/ontology/go/0006810/annotation/page/1 transport]), ([/ontology/go/0016021/annotation/page/1 integral to membrane]). Seven different families (A to G) have been defined in eukaryotes based on sequence homology, domain topology, and function. ''Dictyostelium'' has 71 ABC transporters (including one on the chromosome 2 duplication) and 13 ABCC family members: [/gene/DDB_G0280541 abcC1], [/gene/DDB_G0280055 abcC2], [/gene/DDB_G0287691 abcC3], [/gene/DDB_G0286559 abcC5], [/gene/DDB_G0287593 abcC6], [/gene/DDB_G0291243 abcC7], [/gene/DDB_G0284867 abcC8], [/gene/DDB_G0285165 abcC9], [/gene/DDB_G0280977 abcC10], [/gene/DDB_G0280973 abcC12], [/gene/DDB_G0280539 abcC13], [/gene/DDB_G0287589 abcC14], and [/gene/DDB_G0280459 abcC15]. Transporters of the C family have been shown to transport glutathione conjugants as well as to export cadmium ions.

Seven different families (A to G) have been defined in eukaryotes based on sequence homology, domain topology, and function. ''Dictyostelium'' has 71 ABC transporters (including one on the chromosome 2 duplication) and a single ABCE family member. The ABCE family is characterized by the presence of a conserved ferredoxin motif (pfam00037) at the N terminus, a motif found in nucleic acid binding proteins. They contain two ABC domains but no transmembrane domains and so are unlikely to act as transporters. In animals, ABCE protein has been shown to inhibit RNase L, the double-stranded RNA nuclease, and is referred to as RLi [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6420574  (Anjard and Loomis 2002)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-SEP-2003 PG

DDB_G0275689	Pascale Gaudet	''abcG2'' and [/gene/DDB_G0275687 abcG18] are present in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome as a tandem. In insertional mutant that disrupts both ''abcG2'' and [/gene/DDB_G0275687 abcG18] (''mdrA1/mdrA2'') results in release from the developmental block and the suppression of the defect in initial cell type choice caused by loss of the [/gene/DDB_G0271916 rtoA] gene. AbcG2 is localized to the endosome ([/ontology/go/0005768/annotation/page/1 endosome]). ''abcG2-/abcG18-'' cells have an endocytosis rate roughly 70% that of wild-type ([/ontology/go/0006897/annotation/page/1 endocytosis]).

DDB_G0275157	Pascale Gaudet	LimF was isolated on the basis of its LIM domain, a domain important for cytoskeletal function. A two-hyrbrid screen was performed, which identified two interacting partners, [/gene/DDB_G0267490 ChLim], another LIM domain-containing protein, as well as [/gene/DDB_G0286553 rab21], a small GTPase of the Rab subfamily. The two amino LIM domains of LimF, LIM1 and LIM2, were able to bind ChLIM and Rab21, but not LIM3, the most carboxy LIM domain. ChLim and LimF interaction with Rab21 is not dependent on the ability of Rab21 to bind GTP. Mutations in these three genes indicate that ChLim play a role in the [/ontology/go/0050765/annotation/page/1 negative regulation of phagocytosis], while LimF and Rab21 are involved in the [/ontology/go/0050766/annotation/page/1 positive regulation of phagocytosis].

DDB_G0269214	Pascale Gaudet	The ABC superfamily of genes is one of the largest in the genomes of both bacteria and eukaryotes. The proteins encoded by these genes all carry a characteristic 200- to 250-amino-acid ATP-binding cassette that gives them their family name ([/ontology/go/0042626/annotation/page/1 ATPase activity, coupled to transmembrane movement of substances]). In bacteria they are mostly involved in nutrient import, while in eukaryotes many are involved in export ([/ontology/go/0006810/annotation/page/1 transport]). Seven different families have been defined in eukaryotes based on sequence homology, domain topology, and function. Sequences from the well-advanced ''Dictyostelium'' genome project have allowed to recognize 71 members of this superfamily (including one on the chromosome 2 duplication). The ABCG family is characterized by the ABC domain preceding the transmembrane domain ([/ontology/go/0016021/annotation/page/1 integral to membrane]). All of the members of this family in animals are half-transporters while all of the fungal members are full transporters with two ABC-transmembrane units. No members of this family are found in bacteria. ''Dictyostelium'' and ''Arabidopsis'' have members of both types ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12456012 Anjard and Loomis 2002]).

DDB_G0275011	Robert Dodson	To investigate the minimal requirements for chemotaxis, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22081140  Kortholt et al. 2011] obtained quantitative data on Ras activation and chemotaxis in cAMP and folic acid gradients using a variety of Dictyostelium mutant cell lines from the four signaling pathways that contribute to chemotaxis: PI3K, TorC2, PLA2, and sGC. Their results demonstrate that Ras is activated at the leading edge, through a pathway consisting of G-alpha/beta/gamma, which does not depend on either of the four pathways. The authors measured chemotaxis of mutant cells exposed to cAMP gradients with different steepness and found that many mutants will chemotax in shallow gradients, despite a reduced sensitivity. Expression of multiple pathways increases sensitivity, with some combinations of pathways exhibiting weak amplification while others produce good chemotaxis with strong signal amplification. The results of cluster analysis revealed that one cluster of signaling pathways, including PI3K + TorC2 + sGC, is involved in inducing orientation of the cell towards the gradient, while a second cluster consists of cGMP + PLA2 and functions as a memory of current direction. Thus one individual pathway does not contribute strongly to chemotaxis, but it can synergize with other pathways, which together increases the sensitivity about 150-fold. These results suggest a conceptual model of chemotaxis in which a basal signaling module consisting of heterotrimeric and monomeric G proteins provides activation of Ras at the leading edge, which is sufficient for chemotaxis.Basic annotations have been added to this gene, 22-DEC-2014 RD

DDB_G0287101	Robert Dodson	NoxA ([/gene/DDB_G0289653 noxA]), NoxB and NoxC ([/gene/DDB_G0291117 noxC]) are homologs of the heme-containing subunit of NADPH oxidase flavocytochromes that generate superoxide for defense and signaling. Each of them has 6 predicted transmembrane regions and uses 4 histidine moieties to bind 2 heme groups. Mutations that inactivate the ''nox'' genes in the genetic background of strain JH10 result in a developmental block at the tipped mound stage, but have no effect on growth in association with bacteria. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15950752  (Lardy et al. 2005)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16367873  (Benghezal et al. 2006)]. A triple mutant in which ''noxA'', ''noxB'', and ''noxC'' are disrupted in the genetic background of strain AX2 develops normally, but has defects in the defense response to bacteria. The Sentinel cells that normally provide innate immunity in slugs are unable to generate superoxide when all 3 of the ''nox'' genes are deleted. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) stimulate S cells to take up bacteria by phagocytosis and to release mitochondrial DNA nets that trap extracellular bacteria. ''noxA''/''noxB''/''noxC'' triple null mutants release very few DNA nets and fail to clear bacteria from the slugs. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26927887  (Zhang et al. 2016)]. ''noxA'' is expressed at high levels in vegetative cells and at lower levels during development. ''noxB'' and ''noxC'' are only expressed after 6 hrs of development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15950752  (Lardy et al. 2005)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 21-DEC-2018 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

DDB_G0287823	Robert Dodson	An ''lrrB'' disruptant strain grows and develops normally until the tipped mound phase, but subsequent development is delayed by several hours and results in misshapen fruiting bodies. Gene expression in ''lrrB'' null cells is aberrant during growth, including multiple genes that are either under, or over-expressed. In addition, LrrB was determined to interact with 3 proteins: FttB, CldA, and CldB. The additional finding that 3 LrrB-regulated genes are similarly misregulated in a ''cldA'' disruptant strain suggests that LrrB and CldA interact to control gene expression during growth and early development. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20457612  (Sugden et al. 2010)]<br />Further research by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21396932  Sugden et al. 2011] characterized the role of ''lrrB'' in multicellular development. Slug formation in ''lrrB'' null mutants is delayed, and the slugs are highly defective in both phototaxis and thermotaxis. ''LrrB'' also develops differently in the darkness than in the light; in the dark, mutants arrest development as an elongated mound, a process termed dark stalling by the authors. LrrB null slugs are defective in pstO prestalk cell differentiation and display aberrant gene expression patterns, including reduced expression of the ecmB gene. In addition, ''LrrB'' null culminants have aberrant morphology, lacking a basal disc and sometimes containing multiple stalk fragments. These results suggest that LrrB is an adaptor protein which is active in diverse developmental signaling pathways. Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 12-NOV-2014 RD
DDB_G0286069	Robert Dodson	DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) can be repaired by either non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR). In vertebrates, NHEJ is initated when Ku70/Ku80 heterodimers bind to DNA ends and recruit the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs). Homologs of these components in Dictyostelium are encoded by ''ku70'', ''ku80'' ([/gene/DDB_G0286303 ku80]),and ''dnapkcs'' ([/gene/DDB_G0281167 dnapkcs]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16243037  (Hudson et al. 2005)]. Both Ku70 and Ku80 are members of the family of ATP-dependent DNA helicases and are coordinately expressed during growth and early development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16112620  (Block and Lees-Miller, 2005)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. Poly ADP-ribose is generated by the polymerase Adprt1a ([/gene/DDB_G0278741 adprt1A]) at sites of DNA DSBs. Poly ADP-ribose polymers promote NHEJ by binding Ku70 at DSBs and attaching Ku80 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21807880  (Couto et al. 2011)]. Ku80 has a C-terminal domain that binds DNA-PKcs together with the homolog of the DNA repair endonuclease Artemis, Dclre1 ([/gene/DDB_G0277755 dclre1]), that is essential for NHEJ [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16112620  (Block and Lees-Miller, 2005)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16582628  (Hsu et al. 2006)]. Null mutations in either ''ku70'' or ''dnapkcs'' render recently germinated cells unusually sensitive to the DSB-inducing agent bleomycin. However, these mutations have no effect on bleomycin sensitivity of populations of growing cells, probably because DSBs can be repaired by the HR pathway in cells with two copies of each gene. Haploid cells emerge from spores in the G1 phase of the cell cycle where HR is inoperable; however, growing cells are in G2 where HR can compensate for loss of NHEJ [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16243037  (Hudson et al. 2005)]. The DNA joining events that result in integration of plasmid sequences at random sites of double-strand cleavage during REMI mutagenesis appear to depend on the NHEJ pathway, since ''ku70'', ''ku80'', ''adprt1a'' and ''dclre1'' null mutants do not show the increase in plasmid integration seen in wild type cells transformed together with restriction enzymes [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21807880  (Couto et al. 2011)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21536833  (Hsu et al. 2011)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 04-JAN-2019 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

''noxA''/''noxB''/''noxC'' triple null mutants release very few DNA nets and fail to clear bacteria from the slugs. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26927887  (Zhang et al. 2016)]. ''noxA'' is expressed at high levels in vegetative cells and at lower levels during development. ''noxB'' and ''noxC'' are only expressed after 6 hrs of development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15950752  (Lardy et al. 2005)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 20-DEC-2018 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0269024	Robert Dodson	''ate1'' encodes the highly conserved enzyme arginyltransferase which is responsible for the post-translational conjugation of arginine to the N-terminal aspartate or glutamate of a protein. Ate1 is localized to both the nucleus and cytosol, and transiently relocates to sites of newly formed actin-rich protusions. ''ate1'' null cells lack focal actin adhesion sites at the substrate-attached surface, and have defects in both cell-substrate adhesion and cell motility. Mass spectrometric analysis identified arginylation sites in actin and several actin-binding proteins, suggesting a role for ''ate1'' in the regulation of cytoskeletal proteins involved in adhesion or migration.

DDB_G0272004	Petra Fey	The ''p2xA'' gene is one of 5 ''Dictyostelium'' genes encoding putative P2X receptors. p2xA has been heterologously expressed in human HEK 293 cells and was shown to have ATP-gated cation channel activity. Mutation of conserved lysines (K67A, K289A) or a conserved aspartate (D330A) to alanine rendered the molecule non-functional. This P2X receptor was also found to be sensitive to Cu2+ ions. Deletion of the ''p2xA'' gene in AX4 wild type cells led to extensive swelling of the cells when placed in water, indicating a defect in cellular water homeostasis. Addition to Cu2+ ions recapitulated the swelling phenotype. Expression of a p2xA-GFP construct localized p2xA to the contractile vacuolar membrane and rescued the defect in the null cells [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17625565  (Fountain et al. 2007)].<br />Using an apoaequorin expressing strain, Ludlow ''et al.'' showed that ''Dictyostelium'' posseses P2X receptors that facilitate rapid Ca2+ influx in response to extracellular ATP and ADP. Deleting ''p2xA'' or [/gene/DDB_G0288061 p2xE] did not influence this behavior, suggesting these genes are not involved. However, this study proposes possible roles for [/gene/DDB_G0275293 p2xB], [/gene/DDB_G0275191 p2xC], or [/gene/DDB_G0288335 p2xD] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18486207  (Ludlow et al. 2008)].<br />Ludlow ''et al.'' also showed that P2xB and P2xE, as well as P2xA, have ATP-gated channel activity when expressed in ''Xenopus'' oocytes. However, Na+ inhibited this activity to various degrees in these P2x channels, but K+, and NH4+ ions elicited a large response. Interestingly, P2xA and P2xB, but not P2xE are permeable to Cl- ions. No such ATP-gated channel activity was found for P2xC and P2xD. All ''Dictyostelium'' P2x proteins localize to the contractile vacuolar membrane, and not to the plasma membrane like P2x receptors from other organisms. The transmembrane loop region containing the agonist (ATP) binding site lies within the lumen of the vacuole. Also, A quintuple ''p2xA/B/C/D/E'' null mutant in wild type AX2 shows a reduced response to the calmodulin inhibitor calmidazolium, suggesting a role of the ''Dictyostelium'' proteins in the regulation of calcium-mediated signaling. The quintuple null mutant also shows a slight delay in its hypotonic response when placed in water, however, single mutants in a AX2 background do not show any osmoregulatory defect. Taken together, this study suggests that it is still unclear which molecules are responsible for the extracellular purinergic response in ''Dictyostelium'' and it raises the possibility that the P2x receptors may play a role in the release of intracellular Ca 2+ stores in response to an ATP stimulus from within the contractile vacuole [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19833731  (Ludlow et al. 2009)].<br />The study by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22736763  Sivaramakrishnan and Fountain 2012] reported that the P2x receptor ATP binding site faces into the vacuole lumen and ATP translocation triggers P2x receptor-dependent release of calcium. Thus the P2xA receptor in ''Dictyostelium'' is a calcium release channel. In a later study they reported that two commonly used laboratory strains of ''Dictyostelium'' display different phenotypes in response to hypotonic stress.The magnitude of contractile vacuolar calcium, released in response to ATP, differs substantially between AX2 and AX4, with the magnitude of release being significantly smaller in AX2 cells [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23221467  Sivaramakrishnan and Fountain 2013]. The results confirm those from [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19833731  Ludlow et al. 2009] that AX2 cells are not dependent on ''p2xA'' for normal volume regulation, and also substantiate findings from [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17625565  Fountain et al. 2007] that ''p2xA'' is required for normal osmoregulation in AX4 cells.<br />Activation of P2xA results in calcium efflux required for downregulation of Rab11a (gene [/gene/DDB_G0269238 rab11A]) activity and efficient vacuole fusion. Vacuole fusion and Rab11a downregulation require the activity of CnrF (gene [/gene/DDB_G0276119 cnrF]), an EF-hand-containing Rab GAP found in a complex with Rab11a and P2xA. CnrF Rab GAP activity for Rab11a is enhanced by the presence of calcium and the EF-hand domain. These findings support that P2xA activation results in vacuolar calcium release, which triggers activation of CnrF Rab GAP activity and subsequent downregulation of Rab11a to allow vacuole fusion [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24335649  (Parkinson et al. 2013)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 27-NOV-2015 PF

DDB_G0288877	Petra Fey	The armadillo repeats that characterize beta-catenin in metazoa are found in the protein encoded by the ''Dictyostelium'' gene ''aarA'' (aardvark). Beta-catenin plays two independent roles in metazoa, as a component in epithelial cell-cell adhesion, and as an intercellular signal transducer in the Wnt signaling pathway. In ''Dictyostelium'' AarA was found to be a component of actin-associated adherens junctions holding cells together around the top of the rising stalk tube. Mutants lacking AarA form weak fruiting bodies that collapse easily. They also express the prespore marker gene [/gene/DDB_G0267412 pspA] at reduced levels [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11130075  (Grimson et al. 2000)]. If beta-catenin is directly acting to regulate transcription, it is doing so in a manner unrelated to the metazoan Wnt signaling pathway. No ortholog of the intercellular signal Wnt can be found in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome. Likewise, the nuclear proteins TCF/LEF that are targeted by beta-catenin in vertebrates are missing in ''Dictyostelium''.<br />Dickinson and colleagues showed that ''Dictyostelium'' contains a polarized epithelium around the apical tip of the developing fruiting body. The deletion of ''aarA'' resulted in the disruption of this polarized protein organization. Accumulation of cellulose and EcmA/B in the stalk tube is strongly reduced in the mutant. Cellulose synthase ([/gene/DDB_G0269124 dcsA]) and EcmA/B ([/gene/DDB_G0277853 ecmA], [/gene/DDB_G0269132 ecmB]) are mislocalized intracellularly in tip epithelial cells but localization, though weak, is unchanged in stalk cells. This indicates that tip epithelial cells are the primary source of secreted cellulose and EcmA/B in the stalk tube. Aardvark was also shown to bind the ''Dictyostelium'' alpha-catenin ([/gene/DDB_G0285939 ctnnA]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21393547  Dickinson et al. 2011)]. Furthermore, both catenins are essential for apical myosin localization ([/gene/DDB_G0286355 mhcA]) during epithelial tube morphogenesis by regulating cortexillin ([/gene/DDB_G0289483 ctxA]) and Ras-GTPase ([/gene/DDB_G0287585 rgaA]) distribution, thus eliciting a signaling function of beta-catenin in ''Dictyostelium'' [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22902739  (Dickinson et al. 2012)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 10-JUN-2015 PF; annotation contributions: PMID 22902739 Daniel Dickinson; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

DDB_G0282289	Robert Dodson	Disruption of the ''dhkD'' gene resulted in an unusual phenotype. Aggregation occurred without streaming and resulted in motile mounds, a phenotype termed the pollywog stage. After a period of random migration, the pollywogs attempted to form fingers but mostly generated aberrant structures with no tips. While prestalk and prespore cell differentiation occurred with normal timing, proper patterning did not occur. The pollywog phenotype was dependent on a functional RegA, suggesting that DhkD functions to ensure the proper cAMP distribution within mounds.

DDB_G0269114	Petra Fey	Nucleomorphin is a calmodulin binding protein. The numA1 isoform was identified in an expression library screen for calmodulin binding proteins. This protein contains nuclear localization signals (NLS), a Calcium-Calmodulin binding domain (CaMBD), and a glu/asp rich repeat (DEED). A GFP-numA1 fusion protein localized to patches in the nucleoplasm. Cells expressing GFP-NumA1 lacking the acidic DEED repeat showed an increased number of nuclei, which suggests numA1 regulates mitosis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11919178  (Myre &amp; O'Day 2002)]. A longer isoform, numA2, contains an additional BRCT (Breast Cancer C-Terminal) domain found predominantly in proteins involved in cell cycle checkpoint functions responsive to DNA damage. While the shorter transcript is uniformly expressed throughout development, the larger transcript is expressed at low levels during vegetative growth, increasing by 4 h to remain high throughout development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15535983 (Myre &amp; O'Day 2004a)]. A two-hybrid screen using numA1 as a bait identified [/gene/DDB_G0283153 cbpD1], a calcium binding protein, to bind numA1, and this interaction required presence of the DEED domain [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15325281 (Myre &amp; O'Day 2004b)]. It has also been shown that the NLS, not the CaMBD, is sufficient for nuclear translocation of numA1, and that the nuclear localization is crucial for its ability to regulate the nuclear number [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15896312 (Myre &amp; O'Day 2005)].<br />In normal development, numA1 is highly expressed in vegetative cells and expression decreases 80% over the first 4 hours starvation. Differentiation inducing factor 1 (DIF-1) completely blocked the starvation-induced decrease in numA1. Conversely, treatment of vegetative cells with cAMP or ammonia, decreased numA1 expresssion. These results show that numA1 expression is regulated by developmental morphogens [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19000924 (O'Day et al. 2008)].<br />In 2011, mumA1 has been found to localize to nucleoli and to a lesser degree to the nucleoplasm in interphase. During mitosis, numA1 relocalizes to the centrosome and nuclear envelope. Nuclear or nucleolar localization signals ((NLS/NoLSs) have been mapped [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21327858 (Catalano &amp; O'Day 2011)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 23-OCT-2012 PF

DDB_G0284465	Robert Dodson	The ''cudA'' gene was identified in a random mutagenesis screen as being essential for correct culmination[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9226443  (Fukuzawa et al. 1997)]. ''cudA'' was found to localize to the nucleus, and to be expressed both in a cone of cells at the extreme slug tip and in prespore cells. cudA- cells exhibit several phenotypes: they are defective in the expression of certain prespore genes, including [/gene/DDB_G0277141 cotC]; both stalk and spore formation are impaired; and cudA- slugs continue to migrate under conditions in which normal slugs culminate. The latter defect is corrected if the ''cudA'' gene is expressed in cudA- cells under the control of a promoter that selectively directs expression to the anterior of the prestalk region. CudA directly regulates ''cotC'' prespore gene expression by binding to a site in the ''cotC'' promoter. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18701541  Yamada et al. 2008]).<br />[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10821768  (Fukuzawa and Williams 2000)] demonstrated that STATa ([/gene/DDB_G0281381 dstA]), activates ''cudA'' expression in tip-organizer cells of the migrating slug. CudA directly activates [/gene/DDB_G0288331 expl7] gene expression there, suggesting that ''cudA'' plays a transcriptional role in tip-organizer cell differentiation. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19757394  (Wang et al. 2010)]. For pstA-specific genes, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27125566  (Saga et al. 2016)] demonstrate two distinct signaling pathways downstream of STATa: CudA-dependent and CudA-independent. In addition to ''expl7'', cudA also activates ''aslA'' ([/gene/DDB_G0273213 aslA-1], [/gene/DDB_G0273713 aslA-2]) and ''7E'' ([/gene/DDB_G0275437 7E]) gene expression.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-OCT-2016 RD

Sec7 was observed in both the cytosol and the plasma membrane, yet is absent from the plasma membrane when cells formed pseudopods, macropinosomes or phagosomes. Analysis of a sec7 knockout implicates the protein in processes that are related to membrane flow and actin dynamics such as phagocytosis and cell motility; however cellular properties associated with mammalian cytohesins such as cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion were not altered.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 16-AUG-2013 RD; annotation contributions PMID:23915312 Angelika Noegel

DDB_G0291231	Robert Dodson	MHCK A ([/gene/DDB_G0291231 mhkA]) was the first myosin heavy chain kinase identified, purified as a 130 kDa protein. It was found to phophorylate myosin II on the heavy chain (MHC, [/gene/DDB_G0286355 mhcA]) driving myosin filament disassembly [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3027076  (Cote &amp; Bukiejko 1987)]. In this study MHCK A was found to phosphorylate threonine residues, later these threonine residues were identified to be at positions 1823, 1833, and 2029 in the tail region of myosin II [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2839474  (Vaillancourt et al. 1988)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2387408  (Luck-Vielmetter et al. 1999)]. It was shown that MHCK A activity is activated by autophosphorylation, and that the presence of myosin II increased the rate of autophosphorylation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2176841  (Medley et al. 1990)]. Furthermore it was shown that MHCK A has a high preference for threonine; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18381083  Luo et al. 2001], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18381083  Crawley &amp; Cote et al. 2008])) and neighboring peptide residues important for substrate specificity have been determined ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18381083  Crawley &amp; Cote et al. 2008]).<br />In 1995, Futey ''et al.'' cloned the ''mhkA'' gene encoding MHCK A and found that no part of the sequence displayed significant similarity to the catalytic domain of conventional eukaryotic protein kinases. However, both native and recombinant MHCK A displayed bona fide kinase activity. In the 1,146 amino acid sequence they identified an N-terminal coiled-coil domain followed by a then uncharacterized central domain; the roughly 290 C-terminal amino acids were found to contain several G-protein beta WD-40 repeats [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7822274  (Futey et al. 1995)]. The WD40 repeat domain has been shown to directly bind myosin II and to facilitate myosin phosphorylation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11106661  (Steimle et al. 2001) ]. The central domain was later identified as the unconventional Alpha kinase domain found in all ''Dictyostelium'' myosin heavy chain kinases and in metazoan elongation factor 2 (eEF-2) kinases (reviewed in [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15050379  Drennan &amp; Ryazanov 2004)].<br />Crosslinking [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7822274  (Futey et al. 1995)] and in vivo truncation studies [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9201999  (Kolman &amp; Egelhoff 1997)] demonstrated that the N-terminal coiled-coil domain is responsible for protein homooligomerization, confirming earlier observations that the 130 kDa protein eluted from gel filtration columns with a molecular mass greater than 700 kDa [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3027076  (Cote &amp; Bukiejko 1987)]. Other studies showed that the coiled-coil region is responsible for direct actin filament binding in order to localize the enzyme to anterior F-actin-rich structures [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11959103  (Steimle et al. 2002)]. It has also been shown that the coiled-coil domain alone binds to F-actin and that this interaction increases the kinase activity 40-fold, suggesting that MHCK A recruitement to F-actin rich sites leading to its activation may represent a mechanism for localized disassembly of myosin [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15545285  (Egelhoff et al. 2004)]. Furthermore, the coiled-coil domain represents a novel actin binding domain that is responsible for actin filament bundle formation and actin crosslink formation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16372899  (Russ et al. 2006)].<br />Deletion of the ''mhkA'' gene led to a strong decrease in MHC phosphorylation resulting in myosin II overassembly. However, defects in the null mutant were milder than defects in cells that overexpressed ''mhkA''; the overexpressing cells showed an increase in MHC phosphorylation and a decrease in myosin II assembly. In addition, these cells displayed reduced growth in suspension, a cytokinesis defect when grown in suspension, and an arrest of development at the mound stage [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8567716  (Kolman et al. 1996)]. These results are consistent with those in earlier studies; here cells that contained myosin that is nonphosphorylatable on MHCK A target sites (3XALA cells), or which is constantly pseudophosphorylated through introduction of aspartate residues, (3XASP cells) were investigated [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7691416  (Egelhoff et al. 1993)]. However, the amount of overassembled myosin was significantly lower in mhkA-null cells than in 3XALA cells, suggesting other MHCKs participate. These results indicate that partial myosin overassembly is not highly deleterious, but that hyperphosphorylation, which inhibits myosin assembly, significantly reduces myosin II function in vivo [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8567716  (Kolman et al. 1996)].<br />[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22899719  (Wessels et al. 2012)] found that MhckA and MhckC were essential for chemotaxis in a spatial gradient of Ca(2+), shear induced directed movement, and reorientation in the front of waves of cAMP during natural aggregation. The phenotypes of mhckA- and mhckC- were highly similar to that of the Ca(2+) channel/receptor mutant iplA- demonstrating that IplA, MhckA and MhckC play a selective role in Ca(2+) chemotaxis, but not cAMP and suggesting that Ca(2+) chemotaxis plays a role in the orientation of cells in the front of cAMP waves during natural aggregation.<br />''Dictyostelium'' has 4 very related myosin heavy chain kinases (MHCK A-D). Three of those (''mhkA'', [/gene/DDB_G0289115 mhkB], [/gene/DDB_G0290687 mhkC]) have been cloned and characterized. The fourth, ([/gene/DDB_G0282489 mhkD]), a putative protein, is very similar to the other MHCKs in sequence and domain structure, making it likely to function as a MHCK (see review [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12952069  De la Roche et al. 2002)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 10-JUL-2008 PF
DDB_G0284839	Robert Dodson	Deletion of the ''ndrC'' gene [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24986648  (Mueller-Taubenberger et al. 2014)] resulted in a severe defect in cytokinesis and an aberrant numbers of centrosomes. NdrC was found to be localized to the centrosome, and pull-down assays revealed that NdrC bound to RasB and RasG. In addition, in ndrC- cells, the levels of activated RasB and RasG are up-regulated, suggesting a functional connection between RasB, RasG, and NdrC. <br />The AGC family of serine/threonine protein kinases derives its name from the founding members: PKA (protein kinase A/cAMP-dependentprotein kinase), PKG (protein kinase G), and PKC (protein kinase C). Other subfamilies exist within the AGC group,including Akt/PKB, NDR (nuclear Dbf2-related), PDK (phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase), and RSK (ribosomal S6kinase).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 16-SEP-2014 RD

DDB_G0273127	Robert Dodson	The homeodomain is a sequence-specific DNA binding motif that consists of a helix-turn-helix. Homeobox-containing proteins have transcription factor activity.

DDB_G0280961	Robert Dodson	The first member of a two-component system, the histidine kinase DhkA, functions in a signal transduction pathway regulating the terminal differentiation of prespore cells. DhkA was shown to be a transmembrane receptor for the signaling peptide SDF-2 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8670894  Wang et al. 1996)] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10373524  Wang et al. 1999)]. DhkA autophosphorylates a histidine residue, and then transfers the phosphate to an aspartate in the carboxy terminal region from where it is relayed to a histidine in the small H2 protein RdeA ([/gene/DDB_G0282923 rdeA]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9582274  Chang et al. 1998)]. The phosphate on RdeA is in equilibrium with phosphate on an aspartate in the response regulator region of the cAMP phosphodiesterase RegA ([/gene/DDB_G0284331 regA]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10488068  Thomason et al. 1999)]. Phosphorylation of RegA increases its activity which reduces the internal level of cAMP. When SDF-2 binds to the external CHASE domain of DhkA, it converts the protein kinase to a protein phosphatase which reduces the activity of RegA and allows cAMP levels to increase ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15897458  Anjard et al. 2005)]. High levels of cAMP activate PKA ([/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC], [/gene/DDB_G0279413 pkaR]) which induces rapid sporulation in culminants.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 16-OCT-2015 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

Tom1, like mammalian Tom1, interacts with ubiquitin, clathrin and Tsg101, a component of the ESCRT-I complex. Tom1participates in a minimal ESCRT-0 complex that could be recruited to endosomal membranes by its direct interaction with phospholipids and the support of Eps15. The authors propose that Tom1 participates in an ancestral ESCRT-0 complex implicated in the sorting of ubiquitinated proteins into multivesicular bodies.<br />Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 28-JAN-2014 RD

Deletion of ''lpten'' revealed cell motility defects similar to those of ''pten'' null cells, but the defects were much weaker. To test for redundant function, the authors overexpressed Lpten in a ''pten'' null background, which resulted in a complete rescue of all developmental, cell motility and chemotaxis defects of the ''pten'' null mutant.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 03-OCT-2014 RD; annotation contributions, PMID:25247494 Daniel Lusche

DDB_G0285995	Robert Dodson	The major extracellular cAMP phosphodiesterase is encoded by ''pdsA'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3023365 Lacombe et al. 1986)]. A signal sequence for secretion is cleaved from the N-terminus along with 49 amino acids. Transcription of ''pdsA'' is initiated at promotors 1.9 kb and 3 kb upstream of the translational start site during growth and early development, respectively ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2157967 Faure et al. 1990)]. After 10 hours of development, ''pdsA'' is transcribed only in prestalk cells starting from a third promotor that is positioned close to the coding sequence. The phosphodiesterase secreted by prestalk cells is necessary for slug and fruiting body formation but not for aggregation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7851634 Wu et al. 1995)]. Null mutations in ''pdsA'' result in non-cell autonomous defects in aggregation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9405107 Sucgang et al. 1997)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19477920 Garcia et al. 2009)]. PdsA is part of the circuit that generates 6 minute oscillations in cAMP during aggregation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9843585 Laub et al. 1998)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15131307 Maeda et al. 2004)].

DDB_G0286121	Robert Dodson	TagC is a composite protein in which a serine protease is attached to an ABC transporter ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7744252 Shaulsky et al. 1995)]. It processes acyl coA-binding protein (AcbA) [/gene/DDB_G0270658 acbA] to generate the 34 amino acid peptide signal Spore Differentiation Factor 2 (SDF-2) that induces rapid sporulation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9473320 Anjard et al. 1998)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15897458 Anjard and Loomis, 2005)]. The protease domain of TagC is exposed to the external environment when gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) signals through the surface G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), GrlE ([/gene/DDB_G0291356 grlE]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16672332 Anjard et al. 2006)]. Since secretion of AcbA is also induced by GABA, the two events are coordinated. Expression of ''tagC'' starts at 4 hours of development and is restricted to prestalk cells in slugs. Development of ''tagC'' null mutants is blocked at the tipped aggregate stage and neither spores nor stalk cells are made. The mutant phenotype is non-cell autonomous as shown by rescue of spore and stalk formation in the mutant cells by co-developing wild type cells. The wild type cells would be expected to generate SDF-2 that could signal nearby ''tagC'' null mutant cells. Tandem duplications on chromosome 4 generated ([/gene/DDB_G0286119 tagB]), ''tagC'', and ([/gene/DDB_G0286123 tagD]) which all encode membrane-embedded proteases ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12456012 Anjard and Loomis, 2002)].

DDB_G0286119	Robert Dodson	The ''tagB'' gene was recovered from a REMI mutant that was blocked at the tipped aggregate stage ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7744252 Shaulsky et al. 1995)]. TagB is a composite protein with an amino-terminal serine protease section and a carboxy-terminal ABC transporter section. TagB processes the secreted precursor of Spore Differentiation Factor 1 (SDF-1) to generate the active phosphopeptide signal that prepares prespore and prestalk cells for terminal differentiation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21602484 Anjard et al. 2011)]. Expression of ''tagB'' starts at 4 hours of development and is restricted to prestalk cells in slugs. Development of ''tagB'' null mutants is blocked at the tipped aggregate stage and neither spores nor stalk cells are made. The mutant phenotype is non-cell autonomous as shown by rescue of spore and stalk formation in the mutant cells by co-developing wild type cells. The wild type cells would be expected to generate SDF-1 in the extracellular space that could signal nearby ''tagB'' null mutant cells. Tandem duplications on chromosome 4 generated ''tagB'', ([/gene/DDB_G0286121 tagC]), and ([/gene/DDB_G0286123 tagD]) which all encode membrane-embedded proteases ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12456012 Anjard and Loomis, 2002)].

DDB_G0273737	Petra Fey	Members of the casein kinase I (CK1) family of serine/threonine kinases have been implicated in many cellular processes. Casein kinases have been shown to phosphorylate the 14-3-3 ([/gene/DDB_G0269138 fttB]) protein in mammals, play a role in Wnt signaling in ''Xenopus laevis'' and ''Caenorhabditis elegans'', and maintain circadian rhythms in ''Drosophila melanogaster''. Additionally, CK1 plays a role in DNA repair in ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' and ''Schizosaccharomyces pombe'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10880352 Moreno-Bueno et al. 2000]).<br />Two casein kinase I family members have been identified in ''Dictyostelium discoideum'', ''cak1'' and [/gene/DDB_G0292354 DDB_G0292354]. Cak1 is highly similar to CK1s in yeast and in metazoans. DDB0216336 is a putative casein kinase I that is highly similar to the CK1 subfamily tau-tubulin kinase (TTBK) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12471243 Manninget al. 2002]). The Cak1 protein has been shown to phosphorylate casein when it is expressed in ''E. coli'' cells, and localizes to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus in immunofluorescence assays. Null mutations and overexpression of a dominant-negative form of Cak1 fail to produce viable cells, indicating that this protein may be essential for growth. Overexpression of wild-type Cak1 results in decreased sensitivity to the DNA-damaging agent hydroxyurea; this suggests a role for Cak1 in DNA repair ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10880352 Moreno-Bueno et al. 2000]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 05-MAY-2004 KP

DDB_G0283615	Petra Fey	''rpkA'' is a member of a characterized class of G protein-coupled receptors found in ''Dictyostelium'' and in the plant pathogen ''Phytophthora'' and that contain a phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K) domain at the carboxyl terminus of the protein ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16876997 Bakthavatsalam et al. 2006]). In ''Dictyostelium'', ''rpkA'' is constitutively expressed and localizes to the endosome. <br />Null mutants in ''rpkA'' fail to aggregate at low cell density due to their inability to respond to cAMP and CMF (conditioned medium factor). The G protein domain of the protein is sufficient to rescue the developmental defects of ''rpkA''-. No role for the PIP5K domain in development has been found, but this domain is required for proper localization of the protein. Double mutants in ''rpkA'' and [/gene/DDB_G0283349 gpaA] (G alpha 1) can bypass the developmental defect of ''rpkA'' nulls, indicating that RpkA is an effector of G-protein coupled receptor protein signaling pathway ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17481898 Bakthavatsalam et al. 2007]). <br />RpkA is also involved in phagocytosis and in the response to infectious bacteria. The protein localizes to late phagosomes, and colocalizes with and binds [/gene/DDB_G0287127 vatA] and [/gene/DDB_G0291858 vatM]. The PIPK domain binds predominantly monophosphorylated phosphoinositides and also phosphatidylserine and loss of RpkA leads to reduced levels of phosphoinositides ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22073313 Riyahi et al. 2011]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 01-NOV-2012 PF

DDB_G0290079	Robert Dodson	A branched heteropolysaccharide, which consists of galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine, is a primary constituent of the Dictyostelium spore coat. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18996984  West et al. 2009] found that disruption of either ''pgtB'' or ''pgtC'' reduced synthase-like activity and blocked heteropolysaccharide formation. Spore coats from an ''pgtB'' ''pgtC'' double null mutant expressed reduced levels of crystalline cellulose, and also contained elevated levels of selected coat proteins. Mutant spores were unusually susceptible to hypertonic collapse and damage by detergent or hypertonic stress. These results suggest that the heteropolysaccharide is essential for spore integrity, which can be explained by a role in the formation of crystalline cellulose and regulation of the protein content of the coat.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 09-OCT-2014 RD

DDB_G0268632	Petra Fey	The ''abpA'' gene encodes alpha-actinin, a 95 kD protein originally isolated from the cell cortex. It forms a dimer, crosslinks actin filaments into lateral arrays, and increases the actin-stimulated Mg ATPase of myosin. Both activities are regulated by Ca2+ [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6746725  (Condeelis et al. 1984)]. The alpha-actinin molecule carries two characteristic EF-hand structures. The calcium-binding loops form the structural basis for the calcium sensitivity [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3622778  (Noegel et al. 1987)]. It was shown that EF hand I has a low affinity for Ca2+ and EF hand II a high affinity, implying a regulatory function of EF hand I in the inhibition of F-actin cross-linking activity [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8486739  (Witke et al. 1993)]. This was confirmed when the viscoelastic properties of F-actin solutions in the presence of mutated EF hand structures was tested, and it was concluded that the first EF hand of alpha-actinin is crucial for its crosslinking function [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8561496  (Janssen et al. 1996)].<br />The phenotype of an alpha-actinin mutant, HG1130, which retained only trace amounts of alpha-actinin, appeared to be normal [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3956480  (Wallraff et al. 1986)]. The lack of alpha-actinin was shown to only slightly affect cell substrate adhesion [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10411959  (Weber 1996)], growth and pinocytosis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10413681  (Rivero et al. 1999)], and development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10704840  (Ponte et al. 2000)]. A redundancy in the microfilament system was suggested when two cytoskeletal genes, ''abpA'' and [/gene/DDB_G0269100 abpC], were disrupted. The loss of both proteins severely affected growth and resistance to osmotic stress. It also resulted in reduced motility and phagocytosis rates, and heavily impaired development. These changes were reversed by expressing either ''abpA'' or ''abpC'', showing the defects to be due to the absence of the two F-actin cross-linking proteins [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1732064  (Witke et al. 1992)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8937986  (Rivero et al. 1996)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 24-NOV-2014 PF

DDB_G0290551	Petra Fey	The ''rblA'' gene is the Dictyostelium ortholog of the conserved retinoblastoma susceptibility gene Rb. ''rblA'' overexpression during growth leads to G1 arrest, but as growing ''Dictyostelium'' are overwhelmingly in G2 phase, ''rblA'' does not seem to be important in the normal cell cycle. ''rblA'' is expressed predominantly in pre spore cells and the null mutant shows a preference for the stalk pathway during development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16495312 (MacWilliams et al. 2006)]. Furthermore, it has been suggested that [/gene/DDB_G0285069 btg] genetically interacts with ''rblA'' in cell fate commitment during development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20300194 (Conte et al. 2010)].<br />Using microarray analysis and mRNA-Seq transcriptional profiling, it has been shown that rblA represses genes whose products are involved in S phase and mitosis. ''rblA'' also activates a set of genes unique to Dictyostelids that function in terminal differentiation during development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22768168 (Strasser et al. 2012)].<br />Bakthavatsalam and colleagues showed that RblA is necessary for the autocrine proliferation-inhibiting factor AprA ([/gene/DDB_G0281663 aprA]) to inhibit cell proliferation. In addition, RblA is required for AprA-induced chemorepulsion, indicating that in ''Dictyostelium'', Rb is necessary for a pathway mediating the effects of a chalone [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24390142 (Bakthavatsalam et al. 2014)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 09-DEC-2014 PF
DDB_G0291714	Robert Dodson	The ABC superfamily of genes is one of the largest in the genomes of both bacteria and eukaryotes. The proteins encoded by these genes all carry a characteristic 200- to 250-amino-acid ATP-binding cassette that gives them their family name ATPase activity, coupled to transmembrane movement of substances. In bacteria they are mostly involved in nutrient import, while in eukaryotes many are involved in export. Seven different families (A to G) have been defined in eukaryotes based on sequence homology, domain topology, and function. ''Dictyostelium'' has 71 ABC transporters (including one on the chromosome 2 duplication) and 11 ABCB family members: [/gene/DDB_G0293416 abcB1], [/gene/DDB_G0293438 abcB2], [/gene/DDB_G0291714 abcB3], [/gene/DDB_G0279915 abcB4],[/gene/DDB_G0292554 abcB5], [/gene/DDB_G0282931 abcB6], [/gene/DDB_G0269720 abcB7], [/gene/DDB_G0293002 tagA], [/gene/DDB_G0286119 tagB], [/gene/DDB_G0286121 tagC], and [/gene/DDB_G0286123 tagD]. The B family includes three main subtypes: full transporters involved in multiple drug resistance (MDR), half-transporters targeted to mitochondria, and half-transporters involved in peptide transport [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12456012 (Anjard and Loomis 2002)].<br />[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25448698  Miranda et al. 2014] show pharmacologically and genetically that ABC transporters mediate cAMP export. They identified several candidates and further characterized one, ''abcB3'', in detail. RNAi-mediated knockdown of abcB3 results in delayed development and decreased extracellular cAMP levels. In addition, ectopic expression of ''abcB3'' is sufficient to increase cAMP export in mammalian cells, suggesting that AbcB3 is a component of the cAMP export mechanism in D. discoideum development.

DDB_G0271676	Robert Dodson	The role of Nwk/Bzz1p-like protein (NLP) and Syndapin-like protein (SLP), in the regulation of the formation and trafficking of WASP-vesicles during chemotaxis was investigated by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19409937  Lee et al. 2009]. Deletion mutants of either ''nlp'' or ''slp'' did not cause significant defects, but deletion of both genes causes the loss of polararized F-actin organization and significant defects in chemotaxis. WASP and NLP are colocalized on vesicles and interactions between the two are required for vesicle formation from Golgi. Microtubules are required for polarized trafficking of these vesicles as vesicles showing high directed mobility are absent in cells treated with nocodazole. Our results suggest that interaction of WASP with NLP/SLP is required for the formation and trafficking of vesicles from Golgi to the membrane, which might play a central role in the establishment of cell polarity during chemotaxis.

DDB_G0272002	Robert Dodson	The ''egeA'' gene was identified during a REMI screen for mutants defective in early development. EgeA was found to be a cytosolic, C2 domain-containing protein. ''egeA'' mRNA is expressed in vegetative and early development cells, with expression reaching a maximum at the 2 hr. developmental stage. ''egeA'' null cells fail to form aggregates and do not enter development. Further, the ''egeA'' null mutant expresses pre-starvation genes, but fails to express early developmental genes required for aggregation, such as cAR1 and GP80. EgeA over expressing cells display a similar phenotype to ''egaA'' null cells, suggesting that an optimal level of Ege A is required for proper function. These results suggest that ''egeA'' is a novel cytosolic protein required for the induction of GPCR-mediated early gene expression [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12142016  (Zhang et al. 2002)].

DDB_G0278781	Robert Dodson	''D. discoideum'' Pah is the only aromatic amino acid hydroxylase in this organism and has phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase activity. Gel filtration showed this enzyme to form a tetramer. As the most efficient cofactor this enzyme requires DH<sub>4</sub> (''D-threo''-BH<sub>4</sub>), and with lower efficiency BH<sub>4</sub>, which is the major cofactor of metazoan PAH enzymes tetrahydrobiopterin binding. However, ''Dictyostelium'' Pah cannot be activated by L-Phe like its metazoan counterparts. The low affinity for the substrate and the overall lower activity than human PAH may provide a constitutive level of activity in ''D. discoideum'', pointing to an anabolic function of Pah in lower eukaryotes and bacteria. A more strict allosteric regulation of the enzyme by L-Phe seems to be needed in higher eurkaryotes. By determining the structure of ''D. discoideum'' Pah, high similarity to human PAH in the catalytic domain was found. However, differing residues could be identified in the regulatory domain that might be important for cofactor selection and L-Phe binding ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18835579 Siltberg-Liberles et. al 2008)].<br />In vivo studies to clarify the roles of L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH<sub>4</sub>) and its stereoisomer D-threo-BH4 (DH<sub>4</sub>) in ''D. discoideum'' suggested that BH<sub>4</sub> is the preferred cofactor for Pah, and that DH<sub>4</sub> functions mainly as an antioxidant ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21871890 Kim et. al 2011)]. In a subsequent publication, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23017206 Kim et. al 2012] studied the regulatory function of Pah by characterizing the oligomeric status and kinetic parameters of both full-length and partial Pah constructs consisting of the regulatory, tetramerization, or both domains. Their results suggest that phenylalanine activates Pah, which is functional in vivo as a tetramer. In addition, kinetic studies suggest that the regulatory domain of dicPAH may play a role different from that of the domain in mammalian PAH.Gene has been comprehensively annotated 19-FEB-2013 RD

DDB_G0284171	Robert Dodson	 The CHD (chromodomain-helicase-DNA binding) protein family is one of the major ATP-dependent, chromatin remodeling factors that regulate nucleosome positioning and access of transcription factors and RNA polymerase to the eukaryotic genome. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24301467  Platt et al. 2013] identified three CHD orthologs (ChdA, ChdB and ChdC) in ''Dictyostelium discoideum'' which are expressed throughout development, but with unique patterns. ChdA shows the strongest similarity to human CHD subfamily I, and ''chdA'' has low relative expression during aggregation and early development, but increased abundance during terminal differentiation. ''chdA'' null cells exhibited a significant delay at the onset of culmination and displayed reduced chemotaxis to cAMP. Genome-wide (RNA-seq) transcriptome profiling for each CHD null strain revealed that the different CHDs regulate distinct gene sets during both growth and development.

DDB_G0286663	Robert Dodson	Monoclonal antibodies were used to recognize a family of secreted proteins in the extracellular matrix (ECM) deposited on the substratum by migrating slugs ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7729573 Ti et al. 1995)]. One of them, Sheathin C, was shown to be a dimer of the 30 kDa product of the ''ecmC'' gene that associates with cellulose in the sheath. mRNA of ''ecmC'' first starts to accumulate at16 hours and peaks at 22 hours of development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420 Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. EcmC is unlikely to be essential for the formation of sheath at the mound stage because it is not expressed early enough, but it could play an important role in the sheath at later stages of development. ''ecmC'' is a prestalk-specific gene.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 11-JUL-2016 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0286647	Robert Dodson	''ecmD'' encodes a protein, EcmD, that has almost exactly the same size and amino acid sequence as EcmC ([/gene/DDB_G0286663 ecmC]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7729573 Ti et al. 1995)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11488929 Wang et al. 2001)]. Both of these proteins associate with cellulose in the extracellular matrix (ECM) deposited on the substratum by migrating slugs.

DDB_G0272861	Robert Dodson	''cosA'' was identified by a genetic screen in ''D. discoideum'' for chemotaxis-defective mutants. Its gene product 'costars' belongs to the costars family, and has sequence similarity to the C-terminal region of the mammalian protein striated muscle activator of Rho signaling (STARS). ''cosA'' expression has been shown to be developmental regulated, with expression peaking during the early stages of development. cosA- cells exhibit chemotactic and developmental defects, which have been further shown to be linked to a role for costars in modulating actin cystoskeletal dynamics and cell motility.

AbpG is enriched in cortical/lamellipodial regions and colocalizes with F-actin.The 501-550 residue region of AbpG is essential for AbpG to localize to lamellipodia and is sufficient for binding to F-actin, and represents a novel actin-binding protein domain. ''abpG'' null cells display normal directional persistence but migrate significantly more slowly than wild-type cells. In addition ''abpG'' null cells have significantly higher F-actin levels compared with wild-type cells. These results suggest that ''abpG'' may participate in modulating actin dynamics in order to optimize cell migration.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 27-JAN-2015 RD
DDB_G0267588	Robert Dodson	PIP5 kinase, PikI, produces PI(4,5)P2 and is essential for efficient chemotaxis of Dictyostelium [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24485835  (Fets et al. 2014)]. Without PikI, PI(4,5)P2 levels are reduced by 90%, and while ''pikI'' null cells move at normal speeds, they are highly disorientated in cAMP gradients. Following chemotactic stimulation, Ras is efficiently activated in ''pikI'' null cells, yet Ras-dependent responses (including activation of PKB) are severely impaired. PikI is phosphorylated by PKB, and in vitro studies of a phosphomimic mutant suggest that this phosphorylation increases PikI activity. These results suggest that adequate PI(4,5)P2 levels are required to couple activated Ras to its downstream effectors and that these levels are regulated by PikI, making it a crucial player in gradient sensing.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 05-FEB-2015 RD

Measurements of the specific activity using a p-nitrophenol linked susbstrate in wild type and mutant strains showed that the initiation and termination of synthesis of the enzyme are controlled by the developmental program ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5813341 Loomis et al. 1969)]. Expression of ''nagA'' does not occur until the density of growing cells exceeds 10<sup>6</sup>/ml when a secreted quorum sensing signal reaches threshold ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/567142 Grabel and Loomis et al. 1978)].The mRNA reaches peak at 6 hours of development and declines thereafter ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2972716 Graham et al. 1988)].Since beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase can be efficiently assayed along with other developmentally regulated acid hydrolases in wild type and mutant strains, it has been used to establish an early dependent sequence of developmental events in Dictyostelium ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1033094 Loomis et al. 1976)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 21-MAR-2016 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

A prominent phenotype of ''dio3'' null cells was the breaking of late aggregates into small signaling centers, each forming a fruiting body. cAMP levels, its relay, photo and chemotaxis and cell cell adhesion were also defective in ''dio3'' null cells. Dio3 null slugs had prestalk identity with pronounced prestalk marker ecmA expression. These results suggest that Dio3 has roles in mediating cAMP synthesis/relay, cell cell adhesion and slug patterning.

DDB_G0267978	Robert Dodson	Using a forward genetic screen,[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22847424  Artemenko et al. 2012] identified the Ste20 kinase KrsB, a homolog of tumor suppressors Hippo and MST1/2, as a negative regulator of cell spreading and substrate attachment. Null mutants of ''krsB'' showed a prolonged streaming phase of multicellular aggregation, a reduction in chemotaxis and cell motility, and an increase in substrate adhesion. These phenotypes depended on an intact kinase domain and phosphorylation of a conserved threonine, suggesting that cycling between active and inactive forms of KrsB may provide the dynamic regulation of cell adhesion needed for proper cell migration and chemotaxis.

DDB_G0283699	Robert Dodson	Phg2 was discoverd in a screen for phagocytosis mutants and identified as a serine/threonine protein kinase and a Ras GTPase binding protein; [/gene/DDB_G0291237 rapA], [/gene/DDB_G0293434 rasG], and [/gene/DDB_G0283537 rasS] were found to bind to phg2. The phg2-null mutant is defective in phagocytosis, cell-substrate adhesion, cytokinesis, cell motion, cell morphogenesis, and actin filament organization in cell-substratum contact sites [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15194808 (Gebbie et. al 2004)]. It has been shown that the Phg2 protein also binds PI(4,5)P2 via a novel binding site, and this binding site is sufficient for plasma membrane localization of the protein. This domain was also necessary for the rescue of the phagocytosis defect in the null mutant. Using a GFP fusion of the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate binding site alone showed transient localization to macropinosomes [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16325504 (Blanc et. al 2005)].<br />[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24587195 Vu et. al 2014] generated single and double knock-out mutants of ''phg2'' and ''pyk3'' and found that transcriptional regulation of STATc and STATc-dependent genes was disturbed. The absence of Pyk3 and/or Phg2 resulted in diminished or completely abolished increased transcription of STATc-dependent genes in response to sorbitol. In addition, there was reduced STATc phosphorylation and a significant delay in nuclear translocation of STATc in ''phg2'' and ''pyk3'' null cells. Further results demonstrated that Phg2 is involved in the phosphorylation and hence inhibition of the STATc inhibitor PTP3. These results establish a role for ''phg2'' in the activation of STATc in response to hyperosmotic conditions.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-DEC-2005 PF

A double mutant of ''splB'' and ''pyk3'' is completely unresponsive to hyperosmotic stress-induced activation of STATc. Both Pyk3 and SplB undergo increased autocatalytic phosphorylation when cells are stressed. Pyk3 and STATc were shown to interact. In addition, under stress Pyk3 and SplB accumulate in different parts of the cell: Pyk3 moves from the cytosol to the cortex, whereas SplB accumulates in cytosolic granules that colocalize with PTP3.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 09-APR-2015 RD
DDB_G0293532	Robert Dodson	''Dictyostelium'' is the simplest organism known to employ STAT signaling. STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) proteins are characterized by a DNA binding domain, an SH2 domain, and a site of tyrosine phosphorylation. A STAT becomes activated when a ligand binds to its receptor, inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of the monomeric STAT molecule. Four STATs have been identified in ''Dictyostelium'', [/gene/DDB_G0281381 dstA], [/gene/DDB_G0268638 dstB], [/gene/DDB_G0293532 dstC] and [/gene/DDB_G0275167 dstD]. <br />STATc was isolated by low stringency hybridization using the SH2 domain of STATa as a probe. Upon exposure to DIF, the inducer of pstO cell differentiation, STATc becomes phosphorylated at Y922, dimerizes, and accumulates in the nucleus of pstO cells. Detailed mutational analysis of the STATc protein has shown that the 46 N-terminal amino acidsare sufficient for nuclear localization, while residues 505 to 554 are required for export outside the nucleus. Phosphorylation and dimerization possibly masks the export sequence and favors the nuclear accumulation of STATs ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12506009 Fukuzawa et al. 2003]). <br />The ''dstC'' null mutant develops precociously. The mutant continues migrationunder conditions that favor culmination of parental slugs. The [/gene/DDB_G0277853 ecmA] gene, which is normally only expressed in pstA cells, is expressed in pstA as well as pstO cells in the mutant. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11336701 Fukuzawa et al. 2001]). <br />The hyperosmotic response, response to heat and response to oxidative stress all involve STATc activation through phosphorylation and nuclear localization. Mutants have been analyzed to identify the signaling pathway leading to STATc activation in response to osmotic stress. The response is independent of the [/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC], [/gene/DDB_G0274101 dokA], [/gene/DDB_G0276269 sgcA] and [/gene/DDB_G0275009 gcA] genes.

Research by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24587195 Vu et. al 2014] using single and double knock-out mutants of ''phg2'' and ''pyk3'' revealed that transcriptional regulation of STATc and STATc-dependent genes was disturbed.

In a null mutant for SplB, exposure to DIF-1 does not activate STATc. Conversely, overexpression of SplB causes constitutive STATc activation. SplB phosphorylates STATc on Tyr922 in vitro and complexes with STATc both in vitro and in vivo. <br />The tyrosine kinase like enzymes SplB and Pyk3 were shown to be involved in the hyper osmotic-induced activation of STATc.

DDB_G0293008	Petra Fey	''Dictyostelium cpnA'' belongs to the highly conserved copines, a family of ubiquitious Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipid-binding proteins. In their N-terminal half, copines contain two Ca(2+)- and phospholipid-binding domains (C2 domains) present in such proteins as phospholipase C and protein kinase C. Much of the C-terminal half consists of a von Willebrand Factor type A domain (VWFA) typically found in the extracellular portions of membrane proteins like integrins. Thus copines represent a fusion of intracellular (C2) and extracellular (VWFA) domains. However, there are no signal sequence or hydrophobic transmembrane sequences in the predicted proteins suggesting copines are intracellular proteins. Copines are thought to be involved in membrane trafficking. It is of particular interest that copines, first found in the highly phagocytic protozoan ''Paramecium'' and then isolated from mammalian spleen and liver, seem to be abundant in cells and organs that are, or contain, phagocytes. In this context it comes as no surprise that phagocytic ''Dictyostelium'' has a total of six copine genes. The widespread distribution of copines from protozoans to mammals and their high similarity suggest they play important role(s) in eukaryotic biology. Reviewed in [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12440769  (Tomsig and Creutz, 2001)].<br />CpnA has been shown to be expressed throughout the life cycle and to bind ''Dictyostelium'' membranes in a calcium-dependent manner. A GFP-CpnA fusion construct showed CpnA to localize to the cytosol, and transiently, in a calcium-dependent manner, to the plasma membrane, the contractile vacuolar membrane, the phagocytic vesicle membrane, and to membranes of the endolysosomal pathway [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16343335  (Damer et al. 2005)].<br />Smith and colleagues found that CpnA is involved in the regulation of aggregation, slug size, and culmination during ''Dictyostelium'' development. In addition, CpnA seems to be involved in the function and differentiation of prestalk cells and plays a role in a calcium-regulated signaling pathway critical to triggering the initiation of culmination [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20525180  (Smith et al. 2010)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 21-AUG-2012 PF

DDB_G0268616	Robert Dodson	The ''Dictyostelium'' XMAP215 family member DdCP224 encoded by the ''cepJ'' gene is involved in centrosome duplication and cytokinesis and is concentrated at the centrosome and microtubule tips. The functions of the N- and C-terminal halves of DdCP224 were investigated using GFP-fusion proteins. The N-terminal construct shows only cytosolic localization, whereas the C-terminal construct localizes exclusively to the centrosome. Both ends of the protein are required for microtubule binding ''in vitro'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10769206 Graf et al. 2000], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12134070 Rehberg and Graf 2002]). Overexpression of the ''cepJ'' gene leads to supernumerary microtubule-organizing centers and, independently, an increase of the number of multinuclear cells. In contrast, underexpression of ''mtaA'' inhibits cell growth, reduces the number and length of astral microtubules, and causes nocodazole hypersensitivity ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14517319 Graf et al. 2003]).Basic annotations have been added to this gene, 26-SEP-2012 RD

DDB_G0275711	Petra Fey	The [/gene/DDB_G0275711 nhe1] gene, predicted to have sodium-hydrogen antiporter activity, is expressed in chemotactically competent cells but not in vegetative cells. Immunostaining for Nhe1 shows that the protein is localized at the membrane, cytoplasm, and in the leading edge membrane of chemotaxing cells. Null ''nhe1-'' cells have a reduced level of intracellular pH (regulation of intracellular pH), a reduced chemotaxis rate, and mislocalized F-actin. Additionally, ''nhe1-'' cells do not have a polarized cell morphology, however, they retain the ability to sense a gradient, as indicated by asymmetric localization of GFP-CRAC ([/gene/DDB_G0285161 dagA]) in response to a PI3-kinase inhibitor ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15851518 Patel and Barber 2005]). <br /> Barber and colleagues showed that expression of the [/gene/DDB_G0278733 aip1] gene suppresses the ''nhe-'' chemotaxis and F-actin assembly phenotype, while expressing just a C-terminal fragment enhances these phenotypes. Since the Aip1 C-terminal fragment binds cofilin they suggest a cooperative role of Aip1 and cofilin in pH-dependent cell migration, and that the defective chemotaxis in ,''nhe1-'' cells is determined primarily by loss of cofilin-dependent actin dynamics ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20668166 Patel and Barber 2010]).<br /> Extracellular Ca2+ and K+ have long been known to affect cell motility. Nhe1 plays no role in Ca2+ facilitation or the Ca2+ requirement for chemotactic orientation. However, Nhe1 has been shown to be involved in both K+ facilitation for motility (at a minimum of 15 mM) and a K+/ Na+ requirement for chemotactic orientation. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21239624 Lusche et al.2011]). <br /> Wessels and colleagues found that nhe1, like [/gene/DDB_G0272344 htt], is required for calcium chemotaxis and for potassium-facilitated chemotaxis.

[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24301467  Platt et al. 2013] identified three CHD orthologs (ChdA, ChdB and ChdC) in ''Dictyostelium discoideum'' which are expressed throughout development, but with unique patterns. ''chdB'' expression shows peak abundance at 4 hours of development which then declines and is undetectable during late development. ''chdB'' null cells exhibited a 2-4 hr. delay in development. Genome-wide (RNA-seq) transcriptome profiling for each CHD null strain revealed that the different CHDs regulate distinct gene sets during both growth and development.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 23-JAN-2015 RD
DDB_G0279735	Robert Dodson	Limiting nutrients stimulate the protein kinase YakA ([/gene/DDB_G0283605 yakA]) to inhibit PufA, a member of the PUF family of evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding proteins related to ''Drosophila'' Pumilio that serves as a translational regulator of specific mRNAs. PufA binds to a 200 base segment in 3' untranslated regions of pkaC ([/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC]) mRNA and inhibits translation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10375515 Souza et al. 1999)].The ''pufA'' gene was isolated in a suppressor screen of ''yakA'' null mutants that are unable to initiate development.

The phenotypes of mhckA- and mhckC- were highly similar to that of the Ca(2+) channel/receptor mutant iplA- demonstrating that IplA, MhckA and MhckC play a selective role in Ca(2+) chemotaxis, but not cAMP and suggesting that Ca(2+) chemotaxis plays a role in the orientation of cells in the front of cAMP waves during natural aggregation.<br />[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20008082  Franklin et al. 2010] created mhkC mutants lacking the C-terminal WD repeat domains.

DDB_G0286359	Petra Fey	Severin kinase was identified by screening DEAE column fractions of a soluble cell homogenate for kinase activity by adding severin [/gene/DDB_G0289327 sevA], actin, or a severin-actin complex. Kinase activity was detected that phosphorylated severin alone, or in complex with actin. A 62 kDa polypeptide co-eluted with the protein kinase activity. Subsequently the ''svkA'' cDNA was cloned and sequenced. The ''svkA'' gene was found to encode a protein kinase that is, over it's entire length, 51 % identical and 64% similar to human SOK1, a STE20-like kinase that is induced by oxidative stress. Similarity is even higher when the N-terminal catalyic domains are compared (75% / 84%, respectively) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9582328  (Eichinger et al., 1998)]. <br />The substrate specificity of severin kinase has been tested with several other actin binding proteins and different domains of severin. Only severin residues 1-151 and 152-362 turned out to be substrates, suggesting that the kinase phosphorylates severin at at least two sites. Severin kinase is activated by autophosphorylation, and severin phosphorylation was shown to be reduced in the presence of Ca2+. The presence of a STE20-like severin kinase in ''Dictyostelium'' suggests a direct signal transduction induced by stress, from the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton by phosphorylation of the actin-binding protein severin [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9582328  (Eichinger et al., 1998)].<br />When the svkA gene was deleted, the cells showed a strong cytokinesis phenotype leading to multinucleated cells sometimes with more than 30 nuclei. The defect stems from the frequent inability of svkA-knockout cells to maintain symmetry during formation of the cleavage furrow and to sever the last cytosolic connection. GFP-SvkA is enriched at the centrosome and localizes to the midzone during the final stage of cell division. This suggests that SvkA is part of a regulatory pathway from the centrosome to the midzone, thus regulating the completion of cell division [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18042625  (Rohlfs et al., 2007)].<br />Detailed sequence analysis of the severin kinase revealed it to be a member of the hippo related kinases, while it has been identified as an interaction partner of CEP161 (gene [/gene/DDB_G0282851 cepL]). Furthermore, SvkA has been shown to co-localize with CEP161, which in turn inhibits autophosphorylation of the enzyme and it's kinase activity [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25607232  (Sukumaran et al., 2015)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 04-MAY-2015 PF

DDB_G0288511	Petra Fey	The ''sadA'' gene has been identified by its disruption in a substrate adhesion-deficient REMI mutant. SadA- cells grow in plastic dishes without attaching to the substrate. The sadA- mutant also shows slightly impaired cytokinesis, aberrant actin filament organization, and a phagocytosis defect. Deletion of the sadA gene by homologous recombination recreated the original mutant phenotype. Expression of sadA-GFP in sadA-null cells restored the wild-type phenotype. SadA-GFP localized to the cell surface, appropriate for an adhesion molecule. SadA contains nine putative transmembrane domains and three conserved EGF-like repeats in a predicted extracellular domain. EGF repeats are found in proteins known to be involved in adhesion, such as tenascins and integrins, suggesting that sadA is the first substrate adhesion receptor to be identified in Dictyostelium [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12499361  (Fey et al. 2002)]. <br /> Kowal and Chisholm showed that the cytoplasmic tail of the SadA protein has an important function in cell-substrate adhesion. A SadA tailless mutant was unable to rescue the sadA adhesion deficiency and overexpression of the SadA tail domain reduced adhesion in wild-type cells. Mutation analysis revealed that the phosphorylation status of serine residues in the tail region plays a role in adhesion. In fractionation assays SadA was found in the insoluble fraction and was also identified to interact with the actin bundling protein Cortexillin I ([/gene/DDB_G0289483 ctxA]). This might suggest that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation regulates adhesion through the binding of SadA to Cortexillin I [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21441344  (Kowal and Chisholm 2011)].<br /> SadA also plays a role in cell adhesion by controlling the levels of [/gene/DDB_G0287363 sibA] adhesion molecules at the cell surface by stabilizing the intracellular SibA protein and possibly by assisting intracellular transport to the surface[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22219373  (Froquet et al. 2012)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 27-SEP-2012 PF; annotation contributions: PMID 22219373 Pierre Cosson.

It was found to colocalize with [/gene/DDB_G0274109 paxB] in focal adhesion-like complexes. Mutant analysis showed that its involvement in adhesion dependent cytokinesis, or cytokinesis B. Myosin II is required for the contractile ring-dependent cytokinesis (cytokinesis A). A double mutant with mhcA disrupted adhesion on solid substrate completely, as both cytokinesis A were B are disrupted [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19065153  (Nagasaki et al. 2009)].<br />Dickinson and colleagues analyzed the structural similarity of the ''Dictyostelium'' protein with vinculins and alpha-catenins and found that it represents one of the earliest members before the branching of vinculins and alpha-catenins. everal experimental results were convincing that this protein is the ''Dictyostelium'' alpha-catenin homolog and the gene was named ''ctnnA''. CtnnA binds AarA, the ''Dictyostelium'' beta-catenin ([/gene/DDB_G0288877 aarA]), as well as the human beta-catenin. Depletion of ''ctnnA'' through RNAi resulted in a disruption of the polarized tip epithelium organization during development. Cellulose synthase ([/gene/DDB_G0269124 dcsA]) and EcmA/B ([/gene/DDB_G0277853 ecmA], [/gene/DDB_G0269132 ecmB]) are mislocalized intracellularly in tip epithelial cells but localization, though weak, is unchanged in stalk cells. This indicates that tip epithelial cells are the primary source of secreted cellulose and EcmA/B in the stalk tube [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21393547  Dickinson et al. 2011)]. Furthermore, both catenins are essential for apical myosin localization ([/gene/DDB_G0286355 mhcA]) during epithelial tube morphogenesis by regulating cortexillin ([/gene/DDB_G0289483 ctxA]) and Ras-GTPase ([/gene/DDB_G0287585 rgaA]) distribution, thus eliciting a signaling function of alpha-catenin in ''Dictyostelium'' [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22902739  (Dickinson et al. 2012)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 11-JUN-2015 PF; annotation contributions: PMID 22902739 Daniel Dickinson.

DDB_G0293544	Robert Dodson	The ''cepK'' gene (CP250) was identified during a search for binding partners of CAP [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19692569  Blau-Wasser et al. 2009]. CepK localizes to the centrosomal corona. A ''cepK'' null mutant had defects in growth, chemotaxis to cAMP, and development. In addition, loss of CepK affected the nuclear envelope and led to reduced amounts of Sun-1 and interaptin. <br />Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 09-JAN-2014 RD
DDB_G0279915	Petra Fey	The ABC superfamily of genes is one of the largest in the genomes of both bacteria and eukaryotes. The proteins encoded by these genes all carry a characteristic 200- to 250-amino-acid ATP-binding cassette that gives them their family name. In bacteria they are mostly involved in nutrient import, while in eukaryotes many are involved in export. Seven different families (A to G) have been defined in eukaryotes based on sequence homology, domain topology, and function. ''Dictyostelium'' has 71 ABC transporters (including one on the chromosome 2 duplication) and 11 ABCB family members: [/gene/DDB_G0293416 abcB1], [/gene/DDB_G0293438 abcB2], [/gene/DDB_G0291714 abcB3], [/gene/DDB_G0279915 abcB4],[/gene/DDB_G0292554 abcB5], [/gene/DDB_G0282931 abcB6], [/gene/DDB_G0269720 abcB7], [/gene/DDB_G0293002 tagA], [/gene/DDB_G0286119 tagB], [/gene/DDB_G0286121 tagC], and [/gene/DDB_G0286123 tagD]. <br />The B family includes three main subtypes: full transporters involved in multiple drug resistance (MDR), half-transporters targeted to mitochondria, and half-transporters involved in peptide transport [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12456012 (Anjard and Loomis 2002)]<br />The AbcB4 transporter has been shown to anchor the cell-cell adhesion molecule [/gene/DDB_G0285793 cadA] to the plasma membrane [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24426151 (Yang et al. 2013)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 23-JAN-2014 PF
DDB_G0287295	Petra Fey	ForC is a formin that lacks a typical FH1 domain but contains FH2 and FH3 domains; it also contains an N-terminal GBD domain. ForC null mutants were able to aggregate but unable to form slugs or develop into full fruiting bodies. Depending on the substratum, aberrant fruiting bodies or tipped mounds were formed. ForC was found to localize to macropinocytotic crowns and cell contact sites colocalizing with the actin cytoskeleton. These results suggested that forC is involved in cell-cell adhesion during later development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12538772 (Kitayama and Uyeda 2003)]). Further localization studies showed that both the GBD and FH3 domains are required for ForC targeting to cell-cell contacts and early phagocytic cups and macropinosomes ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21846933 (Dames et al. 2011)]) <br />Faix and colleagues found that ForC binds F-actin and crosslinked actin filaments into loose bundles of mixed polarity. The ForC protein is expressed at the onset of early aggregation and peaks around the culmination stage. Accordingly, ForC null cells were markedly impaired in chemotaxis, showing a weaker response to cAMP and a strongly impaired migration speed and development beyond the strongly delayed aggregation stage was very compromised. Spore formation was drastically reduced. When beta-galctosidase was expressed in wild type under the control of the forC promoter, staining was limited to the prespore region and absent from prestalk cells. Furthermore the contact site A gene [/gene/DDB_G0289073 csaA] was expressed 4 hours later in the forC null mutant than in wild type ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23906540 (Junemann et al. 2013)])Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 24-JAN-2014 PF

DDB_G0276287	Robert Dodson	The expansin family of proteins found in plants are required for cell growth. Expansins modify the cell wall,allowing the contents of the plasma membrane to expand, however, their exact molecular function is unknown. Inthe ''Dictyostelium'' genome, six expansin-like sequences exist: [/gene/DDB_G0267846 expl1], [/gene/DDB_G0284677 expl2],[/gene/DDB_G0276287 expl3], [/gene/DDB_G0276937 expl5], [/gene/DDB_G0267844 expl6], and [/gene/DDB_G0279847 expl4_ps], that appears to be an expressed pseudogene. It is proposed that these expansin-like proteins may function in a similar manner in ''Dictyotstelium'', particularly because the extracellularmatrix of stalk cells is analagous to the plant cell wall. The ''expl6'' transcript, however, is the only gene that is developmentally regulated ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6627109 Li et al. 2002], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/507803 Darley et al. 2003]).<br />[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25932374 Kawata et al. 2015] found that ''expl3'' gene expression was reduced in a STATa null mutant. The ''expl3'' gene was developmentally regulated, and expression was limited to prestalk cells. An ''expl3'' overexpressing strain exhibited delayed development and formed aberrant fruiting bodies with a short stalk. In addition, Expl3 was found to bind cellulose.

DDB_G0275173	Robert Dodson	Two homeobox-containing proteins have been cloned and analyzed in ''Dictyostelium'', [/gene/DDB_G0291075 warA] and [/gene/DDB_G0275173 hbx2]. Their expression is developmentally regulatedstarting at the mound stage in response to cAMP and require the transcription factor [/gene/DDB_G0288755 gbfA]. <br />''hbx2'' null mutants are morphologically indistinguishable from wild type cells. The double ''warA/hbx2'' knock out has a phenotype similar to the ''warA'' null mutant, with a slightly enhanced morphological phenotype. Many of the multicellular structures formed arrest at the mound stage,while the remainder proceed through development and form fruiting bodies with anenlarged basal disc and lower portion of the stalk, suggestingthere is an increase in the number of basal disc and stalk cells. This is supported by the observation that the pstO region of ''warA'' null cells is about twice the size of that of wild type cells, with a corresponding decrease in the proportion of prespore cells [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9486804 (Han and Firtel 1998)]. <br />The homeodomain is a sequence-specific DNA binding motif that consists of a helix-turn-helix.

DDB_G0272150	Petra Fey	Williams and colleagues ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24006265  Robery et al. 2013]) identified a G-protein-coupled receptor mutant, grlJ-, by screening a mutant library for resistance to a commonly used bitter standard, phenylthiourea. grlJ- cells showed a significantly increased tolerance to phenylthiourea in growth, survival and movement. Analysis of the cell-signalling pathway involved in the detection of phenylthiourea showed dependence upon heterotrimeric G protein and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, suggesting that this signalling pathway is responsible for the cellular effects of phenylthiourea. This is further supported by a phenylthiourea-dependent block in the transient cAMP-induced production of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) in wild-type but not grlJ- cells.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 22-JAN-2014 RD; annotation contributions: PMID:24006265 Robin Williams
DDB_G0282145	Robert Dodson	The ''ptpC'' gene encodes protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP3. PTP3 is expressed in anterior-like and prestalk cell types. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1423620 Howard et al. 1992)]. The responses to the stalk inducer DIF-1 as well as to hyper-osmotic stress that are mediated by the DNA-binding protein STATc ([/gene/DDB_G0293532 dstC]) are controlled by inhibition of PTP3 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10207040 Gamper et al. 1999)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18840649 Langenick et al. 2008)]. PTP3 dephosphorylates and inhibits STATc by removing a phosphate necessary for its nuclear localization. PTP3 is itself inhibited in response to changes to the cortical cytoskeleton. The protein kinase Phg2 ([/gene/DDB_G0283699 phg2]) inhibits PTP3 by phosphorylating it at S747, while an as yet unknown protein kinase phosphorylates PTP3 on S448.

DDB_G0267382	Robert Dodson	The ''corA'' gene has been shown by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24403600  (Vinet et al. 2014)] to play a crucial role in the initiation of the cAMP response. On starvation, corA- cells displayed chemotaxis and aggregation defects and failed to up-regulate the expression of cAMP-regulated genes. External addition of cAMP to corA- cells resulted in normal chemotaxis and aggregate formation, restoring development and suggesting a functional cAMP relay in the absence of coronin A. These results suggest that coronin A is dispensable for cAMP sensing, chemotaxis, and development per se, but is part of a signal transduction cascade essential for system initiation leading to multicellular development.Basic annotations have been added to this gene, 23-APR-2014 RD; annotation contributions: PMID:24347642 Angelika Noegel
DDB_G0283605	Robert Dodson	Investigations by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24373846 Kim et al.

Constitutive expression of YakA in gcsA- cells rescued the defects in developmental initiation and the expression of early developmental genes in the absence of GSH. These findings suggest that GSH plays an essential role in the transition from growth to development by modulating expression of the genes encoding YakA as well as components that act downstream in the YakA signaling pathway.Basic annotations have been added to this gene, 07-MAY-2014 RD

Continued expression is dependent on extracellular cAMP, and positively regulated by protein kinase A [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7713325  (Hopper et al. 1995)].

DDB_G0288179	Petra Fey	A small family of highly related cell-surface receptors is responsible for the responses to cAMP at different stages of development in ''Dictyostelium''. The members are all 7 transmembrane G protein-coupled proteins but show different affinities to cAMP as well as different cell type specificities. ''carB'' encodes the CAR2 receptor that is expressed briefly in prestalk cells following aggregation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2049880  (Saxe et al., 1991]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8436297  Saxe et al., 1993)]. Null mutations in ''carB'' result in the inability of mound cells to form a tip or progress further in morphogenesis. It appears that CAR2 is required for sorting of prestalk cells in mounds. While prestalk specific genes are expressed normally in null mutants, the prespore gene pspB that encodes SP85 is expressed at &gt;10 fold higher levels in carB- mutants than in wild type cells [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8436297  (Saxe et al., 1993)]. Mutations in ''[/gene/DDB_G0285253 scrA]'', which encodes SCAR, were selected that suppress the block to morphogenesis resulting from loss of CAR2 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9732292  (Bear et al., 1998)]. It appears that CAR2 signaling normally inhibits SCAR to help regulate cell movement. CAR2 has also been implicated in the regulation of the prestalk pathway by facilitating the DIF induction of prestalk genes [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9742091  (Verkerke-Van Wijk et al., 1998)].

DDB_G0277845	Robert Dodson	''dhkB'' is involved in the cytokinin signal transduction pathway regulating spore germination. ''dhkB'' encodes a histidine kinase with several potential transmembrane domains but no extracellular loops of more than 10 amino acids. Spores from ''dhkB'' null cells germinate precociously, a phenotype that is suppressed by ectopic activation of or expression of protein kinase A (PKA) ([/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC], [/gene/DDB_G0279413 pkaR]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9576830 Zinda and Singleton 1998)]. Spores lacking DhkB germinate precociously because they do not respond to the cytokinin germination inhibitor, discadenine, by an increase in internal cAMP. Cytokinins accelerate sporulation in wild type cells, but not in dhkB null mutants ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18216168 Anjard and Loomis 2008)]. The same phenotype is observed in mutants lacking the late adenylyl cyclase AcrA ([/gene/DDB_G0267376 acrA]), that can function as part of a two-component system by accepting a phosphate in its response regulator region. The response to cytokinins is independent of the sole H2 protein of Dictyostelium, RdeA ([/gene/DDB_G0282923 rdeA]), and so does not use the standard phosphorelay pathway. It is possible that cytokinins stimulate direct phosphorelay between DhkB and AcrA which results in an increase in the level of cAMP. Pharmaceutical stimulation of cAMP and PKA activity accelerates sporulation in both dhkB- and acrA- mutants. The cytokinin receptor does not appear to be either DhkB or AcrA since culmination-stage mutants lacking these products bind radiolabelled cytokinin just as well as wild type cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18216168 Anjard and Loomis 2008)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 26-OCT-2015 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

DDB_G0289073	Robert Dodson	The cell surface glycoprotein CsaA mediates cell-cell adhesion via homophilic binding. ''csaA'' encodes the glycoprotein gp80 that is responsible for Contact Sites A ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16453689 Noegel et al. 1986)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16593709 Wong and Siu et al. 1986)]. It is expressed after 6 hours of development when the cells begin to aggregate. At this time, the cells become mutually adhesive even in the presence of 10 mM EDTA. Antibodies specific to gp80 are able to block this EDTA resistant adhesion ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5106016 Beug et al. 1971)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7328669 Murray et al. 1981)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3934167 Siu et al. 1985)]. gp80 is stabilized by addition of N-acetylglucosamine to a threonine in a reaction catalyzed by ModB, the product of ([/gene/DDB_G0291241 gnt2]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6717432 Murray et al. 1984)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4019595 Gerisch et al. 1985)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9092834 Jung et al. 1997)]. gp80 is also phosphorylated ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6178632 Schmidt and Loomis et al. 1982)], and held to the surface membrane by a covalently attached glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol lipid (GPI-anchor) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8081259 Klein et al. 1994)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8294503 Barth et al. 1994)]. Homophilic interactions at the octapeptide YKLNVNDS found near the N-terminus of gp80 are responsible for end-to end adhesion of adjacent cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3320049 Siu et al. 1987)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2582489 Kamboj et al. 1989)]. Disruption of csaA results in loss of EDTA-stable adhesion but does not noticeably affect aggregation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2515990 Harloff et al. 1989)]. Cells overexpressing csaA formed big slugs that gave rise to unusually large fruiting bodies ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1966011 Kamboj et al. 1990)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 15-JAN-2016 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0292206	Robert Dodson	''manA'' encodes the lysosomal acid hydrolase alpha-mannosidase ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5464526 Loomis et al. 1970)]. The specific activity increases more than a thousand fold during development. Since alpha-mannosidase can be efficiently assayed along with other developmentally regulated acid hydrolases in wild type and mutant strains, it has been used to establish an early dependent sequence of developmental events in Dictyostelium ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1033094 Loomis et al. 1976)]. The ''manA'' locus was the first genetic marker for chromosome 6 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1033886 Free et al. 1976)]. No phenotypic difference from wild type was observed in ''manA'' null cells. The mRNA is very low in cells growing on bacteria and rises to a peak at 8 hours of development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2038336 Schatzle et al. 1991)] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20236529 Parikh et al. 2010)]. Expression is dependent on a secreted quorum sensing signal, indicating that this is one of the prestarvation response genes ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2038336 Schatzle et al. 1991)]. The response of ManA to PSF is not mediated by cAMP binding to CAR1 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8366107 Schatzle et al. 1993)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 30-MAR-2016 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

DDB_G0293196	Robert Dodson	Lam ''et al.'' found that the additional deletion of the pcp gene in an [/gene/DDB_G0292390 atg1] null background does not have any effect on necrotic or autophagic cell death; the phenotype of the double atg1-/pcp- mutant is identical to the phenotype of the single ''atg1''- mutant. Thus, in ''Dictyostelium'', which also appears to have no bcl-2 family members, autophagic cell death and necrotic cell death are independent of caspases and bcl-2 proteins ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17889831 Lam et al., 2007]).<br />([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23938384 Saheb et al., 2013]) revealed that Pcp was associated with the contractile vacuole membrane, and using a yeast two-hybrid system identified VatM as a protein interacting partner with Pcp. GFP-Pcp over-expressing cells were susceptible to osmotic stress and in hypo-osmotic conditions were rounded and contained more abnormally swollen contractile vacuoles. Their work suggests that Pcp is essential for Dictyostelium osmotic regulation via its functioning in the contractile vacuole system.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 28-AUG-2013 RD

DDB_G0292220	Robert Dodson	''ecmH'' encodes a 14 kDa protein that contains a cellulose-binding domain. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15309638 Shimada et al. 2004)]. There are 14 other proteins in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome that carry a cellulose-binding domain. Genes encoding 4 of the small cellulose-binding proteins are tightly clustered on chromosome 6 and another 4 are clustered on chromosome 1. mRNA from ''ecmH'' is not found in growing cells or during aggregation; however it accumulates more than 50 fold in prestalk cells between 16 and 22 hrs of development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420 Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. Expression of ecmH as well as the other family members on chromosome 6 ([/gene/DDB_G0291291 ecmF], [/gene/DDB_G0292224 ecmG], [/gene/DDB_G0292222 ecmI], [/gene/DDB_G0292218 st15]) is regulated by the transcription factor STATa ([/gene/DDB_G0281381 dstA]). ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15309638 Shimada et al. 2004)]. Since the slug sheath is made for several hours before ''ecmH'' is expressed, it is unlikely that EcmH is an essential sheath component, and more likely that it is involved in culmination.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 12-NOV-2015 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0293524	Robert Dodson	''Dictyostelium'' [/gene/DDB_G0293524 ppk1] is highly similar to bacterial PPK, which exhibits polyphosphate kinase activity inresponse to stress and starvation. PPK synthesizes long chains of polyphosphate (poly P), however, the ''ppk1-''mutant retains a low level of polyphospate kinase activity. The remaining kinase activity (DdPKK2 activity) is attributed,interestingly, to three proteins identified using mass spectrometry: [/gene/DDB_G0288937 arpA], [/gene/DDB_G0272106 arpB], and[/gene/DDB_G0289511 act28]. Inhibition of these three actin-related proteins with reagents affecting actinpolymerization (such as phalloidin) concomitantly inhibits poly P formation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15496465 Gómez-García and Kornberg 2004]). <br /> Disruption of the ''ppk1'' gene results in low levels of poly P and a growth defect attributed to a phagocytosis defect. In addition, the ''ppk1'' mutant exhibits delayed culmination and a significantly reduced number of spore cells. In addition to its functions in development and phagocytosis ppk1 plays a role in the late stages of cytokinesis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15701689 Zhang et al. 2005]).<br />[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26755590 Livermore et al. 2016] also generated a ''ppk1'' null mutant and confirmed that ''ppk1'' is the sole enzyme responsible for polyP synthesis in ''Dictyostelium''. Their investigations revealed that polyP regulates basic metabolism, general fitness, and spore germination. In addition, they discovered a massive increase in the level of polyP during developmental progression which is linked to the accumulation of inositol pyrophosphates.

Transcription starts very late in development as the cells are beginning to culminate (T=18 hrs). Expression is dependent on the MADS-box transcription factor SrfA ([/gene/DDB_G0281387 srfA]) and the GATA-binding transcription factor StkA ([/gene/DDB_G0277147 stkA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9729488 Escalante and Sastre, 1998)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15075287 Escalante et al. 2004)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2010032 Richardson et al. 1991)]. Transcription starts in the rising culminant at the interface of prestalk and prespore cells and then spreads down through the underlying prespore cells in the sorus ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7607079 Richardson et al. 1994)]. This spatial pattern of expression is the result of stimulation of PKA ([/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC], [/gene/DDB_G0279413 pkaR]) activity by diffusible signals generated by prestalk cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7937993 Mann et al. 1994)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12204259 Escalante and Sastre, 2002)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15897458 Anjard and Loomis, 2005)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 11-MAY-2016 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

The protein carries ''modB'' ([/gene/DDB_G0291241 gnt2])-dependent O-linked carbohydrate post-translational modifications that are recognized by the monoclonal antibody MUD50 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7693675 Watson et al. 1993)].There is a signal sequence at the N-terminus that directs transport across membranes. ''pspB'' mRNA is prespore-specific and starts to accumulate at 10 hrs. of development. The transcription factor GBF ([/gene/DDB_G0288755 gbfA]) binds to a CA-rich element upstream of ''pspB'' that is also found in the regulatory regions of several other genes encoding prespore specific proteins ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8050366 Powell-Coffman and Firtel, 1994)]. Transcription of ''pspB'' is prespore-specific and coordinated with that of ''cotA'', ([/gene/DDB_G0276941 cotA]) ''cotB'', ([/gene/DDB_G0276761 cotB]) and ''cotC'' ([/gene/DDB_G0277141 cotC]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420 Rosengarten et al. 2015)].

SP85 is stored in prespore vesicles in a complex with 5 other proteins including SP96 ([/gene/DDB_G0276941 cotA]) and is released during sporulation such that it can associate with another cellulose binding protein, SP65, ([/gene/DDB_G0277903 cotE]) to form the middle layer of the spore coat ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7844172 Watson et al. 1994)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17416892 Metcalf et al. 2007)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9692967 Zhang et al. 1998)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 10-MAY-2016 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

A cDNA clone of this gene, D19, served as one of the earliest markers of prespore cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6429548 Chisholm et al. 1984)]. It is transcribed during aggregation about 2 hours before the genes encoding the major spore coat proteins ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2550894 Early and Williams, 1989)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1646690 Fosnaugh and Loomis, 1991)]. Unlike the spore coat genes, transcription of ''pspA'' does not depend on PKA ([/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC], [/gene/DDB_G0279413 pkaR]) activity ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8174784 Hopper and Williams, 1994)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7713325 Hopper et al. 1995)]. PspA is a cell surface protein carrying a ''modB'' ([/gene/DDB_G0291241 gnt2]) dependent O-linked oligosaccharide ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3902823 West and Loomis, 1985)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 10-MAY-2016 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0281561	Robert Dodson	Disruption of ''tipA'' by REMI mutagenesis resulted in cells that aggregated normally but were blocked at the mound ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9169048 Stege et al. 1997)]. The gene encodes a prestalk enriched protein that has a conserved PP 2C domain also found in protein phosphatases but is otherwise unrelated to previously characterized proteins. Prestalk cells differentiate in tipA- aggregates but fail to sort out to form an apical tip. They remain as small clumps scattered throughout the mounds. TipA appears to be responsible for cell autonomous sorting of the initial cell types.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 12-MAY-2016 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0276333	Robert Dodson	''tipB'' encodes a 41 kDa protein that functions together with TipA ([/gene/DDB_G0281561 tipA]) at the mound stage in the sorting of prestalk cells to the tip ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10402673 Stege et al. 1999)]. Its amino acid sequence does not show significant similarity to that of other known proteins. Mutant strains lacking TipA or TipB, or both TipA and TipB, form mounds with multiple tips that fail to transform into slugs. The phenotype of ''tipB'' null cells is significantly improved by overexpression of wild type ''tipA'' indicating that these two genes may have overlapping functions.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 12-MAY-2016 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

DDB_G0289875	Robert Dodson	The increased rate of polysaccharide synthesis during culmination is dependent on uridine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase (UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase) activity to generate the needed substrate, UDP-glucose. Biochemical assays found a 10 fold increase in pyrophosphorylase activity between 10 and 20 hours of development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6067273 Ashworth and Sussman, 1967)]. Mutant strains lacking this enzyme activity develop well until culmination but then arrest as gnarled fingers ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/944665 Dimond et al. 1976)]. Characterization of cDNA and genomic clones of ''uppA'' showed that it encodes UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2991046 Fishel et al. 1985)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3035502 Ragheb et al. 1987)]. However, most of the UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase activity during development is produced by the related gene ''ugpB'' ([/gene/DDB_G0277879 ugpB]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12060658 Bishop et al. 2002)]. mRNAs from ''uppA'' and ''ugpB'' accumulate coordinately between 6 and 18 hours of development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420 Rosengarten et al. 2015)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 24-MAY-2016 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0277879	Robert Dodson	''ugpB'' is responsible for most of the uridine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase activity (UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase) during development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12060658 Bishop et al. 2002)]. Biochemical assays found a 10 fold increase in UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase activity between 10 and 20 hours of development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6067273 Ashworth and Sussman, 1967)]. Mutant strains lacking this enzyme activity develop well until culmination but then arrest as gnarled fingers with reduced levels of polysaccharides ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/944665 Dimond et al. 1976)]. Disruption of ''ugpB'' results in reduced levels of glycogen and development ending with small, gnarled fruiting bodies ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12060658 Bishop et al. 2002)]. There is a second gene encoding UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, ''uppA'' ([/gene/DDB_G0289875 uppA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3035502 Ragheb et al.1987)].

DDB_G0281563	Robert Dodson	Members of the Myb family of transcription factors are typically composed of two or three imperfect repeats each of about 50 amino acids. These repeats fold into a variant of the helix-turn-helix motif have DNA binding activity. The Myb motif has been well conserved during evolution (see [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10331990 Guo et al. 1999] and references therein).<br />''mybC'' was isolated as a REMI mutant that is unable to culminate. This defect is non-cell autonomous and can be rescued by overexpression of [/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC]. However even when their defect is bypassed, ''mybC'' null slugs and culminants produce little if any of the intercellular signalling peptides SDF-1 and SDF-2 that are believed to be released by prestalk cells at culmination. In ''mybC'' null cells, several culmination genes are expressed at reduced levels: [/gene/DDB_G0269132 ecmB], [/gene/DDB_G0289075 spiA], [/gene/DDB_G0276941 cotA], and [/gene/DDB_G0276761 cotB]. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10331990 Guo et al. 1999]). ''mybC'' is downregulated in a STATa ([/gene/DDB_G0281381 dstA]) null mutant. In addition, the transcription factor CudA ([/gene/DDB_G0284465 cudA]), as well as additional prestalk genes, such as ([/gene/DDB_G0291291 ecmF]) are downregulated in ''mybC'' null mutants, suggesting that ''mybC'' may work in conjunction with STATa to regulate the expression of prestalk-specific genes. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27125566  (Saga et al. 2016)]). <br />MybC was found in the nucleus of prestalk cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10331990 Guo et al. 1999]) using a beta-galactosidase gene driven by 1.85 kb of upstream sequence and the first 16 amino acids of mybC.

DDB_G0277175	Robert Dodson	Formin G localizes to endocytic cups. Inactivation of the ''forG'' gene results in severely impaired macropinocytosis and phagocytosis, and a reduced F-actin content at the base of phagocytic cups. ForG has weak actin filament nucleation activity, but acts as an actin filament elongator that contributes to the generation of a functional F-actin network during endocytosis. In addition, ''forG'' is directly regulated by the Ras GTPases [/gene/DDB_G0292998 rasB] and [/gene/DDB_G0293434 rasG] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27821733  (Junemann et al. 2016)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 21-DEC-2016 RD; annotation contributions: PMID:27821733 Alexander Junemann
DDB_G0282923	Robert Dodson	Genetic complementation studies were used to assign a series of rapid developing mutants of Dictyostelium to one or another of 3 rde loci. Those carrying mutations in ''rdeA'' were found to have high levels of cAMP ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6298035 Abe et al. 1983)]. Sequence comparisons and phenotypic characterizations showed that RdeA is a component of phosphorelay pathways controlling internal cAMP phosphodiesterase activity ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9582274 Chang et al. 1998)]. A histidine moeity in the 28 kDa RdeA protein accepts a phosphate from an aspartate in histidine kinases, and relays it to an aspartate in the response regulator region of the cAMP phosophodiesterase RegA ([/gene/DDB_G0284331 regA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10488068 Thomason et al. 1999)]. RdeA also facilitates dephosphorylation of RegA when DhkA ([/gene/DDB_G0280961 dhkA]) is converted to a phosphatase after it has bound SDF-2 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10373524 Wang et al. 1999)]. The signaling molecule differentiation-inducing factor 2 (DIF-2) modulates chemotaxis to cAMP via the DhkC ([/gene/DDB_G0274191 dhkC])-RegA-RdeA signaling pathway.

DDB_G0273065	Robert Dodson	Papers from the early '80's suggested that there are two genes, ''dscB'' and ''dscC'', with identical protein sequence but on a different chromosomal location. ''dscC'' is situated next to ''dscD''; the gene corresponding to ''dscB'' cannot be found in AX4. <br />The lectin Discoidin I binds N-acetylgalactosamine and galactose [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4517669  (Rosen et al. 1973)]. Discoidin I subunits associate to form a tetramer [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4858710  (Simpson et al. 1974)] and are expressed from a family of 3 different genes: ''dscA'' ([/gene/DDB_G0273063 dscA-1]) ([/gene/DDB_G0273919 dscA-2]), ''dscC'' and ''dscD'' ([/gene/DDB_G0273067 dscD-1]) ([/gene/DDB_G0273887 dscD-2]).

In addition, discoidin I is thought to play an intracellular role, as mutants in which discoidin genes are not expressed also have an abnormally centered microtubule organizing center and more rounded cell morphology, suggesting a role for discoidins in cytoskeleton organization during aggregation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1334012  (Alexander et al. 1992)]. <br />''Dictyostelium discoideum'' strains that carry bacteria secrete approx. 80 times higher levels of DscA and DscC than non-carriers. Secreted DscA binds to ''Klebsiella pneumoniae''. DscA binding protects bacteria from extracellular killing, promotes their internalization and prolongs their retention in both ''Dictyostelium discoideum'' and mammalian cells.

DDB_G0291342	Robert Dodson	TacA is a homolog of the budding yeast ''S. cerevisiae'' zinc finger transcription factor, Crz1. TacA is translocated from the cytosol to the nucleus after dephosphorylation by the calcium-activated protein phosphatase calcineurin ([/gene/DDB_G0276883 canA]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22944283  (Thewes et al. 2012)]. TacA translocates to the nucleus of ''D. discoideum'' within 3 minutes after addition of 100 mM CaCl2. The effect of calcium on TacA can be blocked by inhibition of calcineurin with 50 mM gossypol. Cells with reduced TacA as the result of expression of tacA-RNAi are delayed in aggregation and form very small fruiting bodies. Expression of prestalk genes ([/gene/DDB_G0277853 ecmA]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0269132 ecmB]), prespore gene ([/gene/DDB_G0267412 pspA]), and calcium up-regulated genes ([/gene/DDB_G0289283 cupC]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0277861 patA]) showed no clear effect of reduction of TacA in the mutant strain [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22944283  (Thewes et al. 2012)]. It is likely that the major roles of TacA occur during early development.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 15-FEB-2018 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis; annotation contribution: PMID 22944283 Sascha Thewes

DDB_G0279409	Robert Dodson	CbfA is a nuclear DNA binding protein that represses genes during growth including ([/gene/DDB_G0271870 agnC]) and induces genes during developement including ([/gene/DDB_G0281545 acaA]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8898890  (Geier et al. 1996)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15470262  (Winckler et al. 2004)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23355006  (Schmith et al. 2013)]. ''agnC'' encodes an Argonaute type protein that is a subunit of the RNA-induced silencing complex RISC. Cells transformed with a construct in which ''agnC'' is driven by act15 have high levels of Argonaute C that block accumulation of RNA from members of the TRE5-A family of repetitive elements [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26339297  (Schmith et al. 2015)]. Likewise, cells with only 5% of wild type CbfA activity as the result of a partially suppressed mutation in cbfA do not efficiently transpose TRE5-A because the high levels of Argonaute C reduce RNA of the repetitive element. These cells fail to develop as the result of lack of induction of ''acaA'', the gene encoding the adenylyl cyclase activity necessary for the generation of the chemoattractant cAMP [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15470262  (Winckler et al. 2004)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16607013  (Siol et al. 2006)]. This developmental block can be bypassed by pulses of cAMP that advance the mutant cells to the aggregation stage where they can sustain expression of ''acaA'' and other genes necesssary for cAMP relay by positive feedback. CbfA (C-Binding Factor) was discovered among proteins that bind to the C-module at the 3' end of TRE5-A which controls synthesis of minus-strand (antisense) RNA [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8898890  (Geier et al. 1996)]. The C-terminal domain of CbfA binds to high dA/dT stretches in the C-module ''in vitro'' but does not regulate C-module promoter activity ''in vivo'' [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10491202  (Horn et al. 1999)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19343174  (Lucas et al. 2009)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21076008  (Bilzer et al. 2010)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 06-MAR-2018 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis; annotation contributions PMID:23355006 Thomas Winckler

DDB_G0271684	Robert Dodson	''grlA'' encodes a member of the evolutionarily conserved family of seven transmembrane receptors that are coupled to G-proteins ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16735079 Prabu and Eichinger 2006)]. GrlA is similar to metazoan gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) B-type receptors with 7 transmembrane domains and a large extracellular domain. Inactivation of the ''grlA'' gene leads to a delay in development at the post aggregation stage and a reduced number of spores ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17950724 Prabu et al. 2007)]. When steroids such as hydrocortisone bind to GrlA during culmination, GABA is rapidly released to trigger production of the 34 amino acid peptide signal, spore differentiation factor 2 (SDF-2). GrlA uses the trimeric G-protein containing the Galpha4 subunit encoded by gpaD ([/gene/DDB_G0285425 gpaD]). Drugs that inhibit the steroid biosynthetic pathway block the production of SDF-2 and reduce spore viability ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19176583 Anjard et al. 2009)]. Likewise, grlA null and gpaD null mutants fail to release SDF-2 in response to hydrocortisone but respond normally to GABA.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 05-FEB-2017 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0289389	Robert Dodson	The ''dtfA'' gene was identified by screening a bank of REMI mutants for clones that could not form tipped mounds during development. The ''dftA'' protein DFTA lacks extensive sequence homology to other proteins, but contains four short motifs which show partial homology to repeats found in mammalian mucins. DFTA was found to localize to the cell surface. dftA null cells have a complex phenotype, including defects in development, cytokinesis, prestalk cell sorting, and cell-cell adhesion. These results suggest that ''dtfA'' may form part of a cell-cell adhesion system that is needed both for optimal aggregation and efficient cell sorting during development.

DDB_G0287679	Petra Fey	TSET is the latest addition to trafficking proteins, which is ancient but frequently lost or reduced in evolution. The TSET complex is a heterohexamer and was named for the protein subunits in the complex, TSPOON (sigma-like), TPLATE (beta-like), TCUP (mu-like), TSAUCER (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, zeta-like), TTRAY1, and TTRAY2. This ancient adaptor complex (AP) was identified in organisms such as Dictyostelids and land plants, such as ''Arabidopsis''. Only the TCUP subunit has been retained in fungi and animals, in mammals it has evolved into the cargo adaptor muniscin. A TSPOON-GFP fusion (gene tstD) has been shown to physically bind the 5 other TSET subunits. The TTRAY subunits are beta-propeller / alpha-solenoid proteins and form the scaffold for the TSPOON, TPLATE, TCUP, TSAUCER, heterotetramer. TIRF microscopy showed a punctate temporary localization of the complex to the plasma membran [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24867644  (Hirst et al. 2014)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated,, 11-DEC-2018 PF

DDB_G0277143	Robert Dodson	Signal transduction from surface receptors is often mediated by heterotrimeric G proteins that dissociate into alpha and beta/gamma subunits when GTP replaces bound GDP on the Galpha subunit. ''gpbA'' encodes the evolutionarily conserved beta subunit which dimerizes with the gamma subunit in the presence of the phosducin-like protein PhLP1 ([/gene/DDB_G0292850 phlp1]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3151181  (Pupillo et al. 1988)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16135826  (Knol et al. 2005)].

''gpbA'' mutant cells have reduced levels of the cAMP receptor CAR1 ([/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1], [/gene/DDB_G0273533 carA-2]) and so do not respond to the chemoattractant cAMP. Consequently, neither adenylyl cyclase nor guanylyl cyclase are stimulated by cAMP and the cells fail to develop [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7790362  (Wu et al. 1995)]. The Cytosolic Regulator of Adenylyl Cyclase (CRAC) ([/gene/DDB_G0285161 dagA]) appears to serve as an adaptor linking beta/gamma subunits to activation of adenylyl cyclase ([/gene/DDB_G0281545 acaA]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8089184  (Insall et al. 1994)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7790361  (Lilly and Devreotes, 1995)]. The cAMP generated when adenylyl cyclase is activated acts as a feedback inhibitor by stimulating PKA ([/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC], [/gene/DDB_G0279413 pkaR]) activity that inhibits ACA activation by beta/gamma/CRAC [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9843585  (Laub and Loomis, 1994)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18783170  (Loomis et al. 2008)]. Galpha2 ([/gene/DDB_G0276267 gpaB]) and Gbeta/Ggamma remain dissociated as long as cAMP is bound to CAR1 which indicates that adaptation of the cAMP response is achieved downstream of the G protein response [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11264536  (Janetopoulos et al. 2001)]. The rate of dissociation of Gbeta/Ggamma from the membrane increases when cAMP is bound to CAR1 which may facilitate activation of cytosolic components such as RasGAPs [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19584094  (Elzie et al. 2009)]. Using an acute ''gpbA'' gene inhibition approach, Hoeller and colleagues suggest that G-beta regulates the strength of coupling between actin oscillators for efficient polarity and directional migration [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26890004  (Hoeller et al. 2016)]. ElmoE ([/gene/DDB_G0279657 elmoE]) associates with the Gbeta/Ggamma subunits and interacts with Dock-like proteins DocC ([/gene/DDB_G0292004 docC]) and possibly ZizA ([/gene/DDB_G0275035 zizA]) to activate the small GTPase RacB ([/gene/DDB_G0279605 racB]) and promote actin polymerization in the leading edge of migrating cells [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22264729  (Yan et al. 2012)]. In addition to its role in cAMP signaling, ''gpbA'' is also involved in folate-mediated calcium signaling-the calcium responses of vegetative cells to folate are dramatically impaired in gpbA and gpaD ([/gene/DDB_G0285425 gpaD]) null mutants [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12952083  (Nebl et al. 2002)].

DDB_G0290853	Robert Dodson	The 'steely' protein StlB catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of differentiation-inducing factor 1 (DIF-1), the prestalk and basal disc inducer [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11163223  (Thompson and Kay, 2000)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16906151  (Austin et al. 2006)]. StlB is a large protein (330 kDa) with six catalytic domains similar to type I fatty acid synthases followed by a type III polyketide synthase domain which catalyzes both iterative polyketide extension and cyclization. This polyketide synthase generates the C12 phlorocaprophenone intermediate that is subsequently modified by the products of ''chlA'' ([/gene/DDB_G0290825 chlA]) and ''dmtA'' ([/gene/DDB_G0289329 dmtA]) to give rise to the chlorinated alkyl phenone DIF-1. ''stlB'' mRNA accumulates only after 7 hrs of development and is found preferentially in prespore cells at the slug stage. Cells in which ''stlB'' is disrupted fail to synthesize any DIF-1 or its unmethylated precursor dM-DIF-1. ''stlB''- mutant strains form long thin slugs with somewhat fewer prestalk cells. Most of the mutant slugs break up leaving a mass of prespore cells that initiates culmination along the substratum. Basal disc cells are missing from the fruiting body and few lower cup cells differentiate to keep the spore mass from slipping down the stalk [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16906151  (Austin et al. 2006)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18402932  (Saito et al. 2008)]. Adding DIF-1 to the environment restores normal development. Most of the phenotypes observed in ''stlB''- null cells are also observed in mutants lacking DmtA, however, defects in expression of prestalk O specific genes are more pronounced in the methyl transferase ''dmtA''- mutants [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12796308  (Maeda et al. 2008)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18402932  (Saito et al. 2003)]. The precursor dM-DIF-1 builds up in cells lacking DmtA and inhibits PstO cell differentiation in slugs.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 29-JAN-2019 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0285175	Robert Dodson	Vmp1 is a transmembrane protein that, like Atg9, is essential for autophagy and may be involved in membrane trafficking. Highly similar proteins are present in lower eukaryotes and plants although a homolog is absent in the fungi lineage. Vmp1 contains a domain of unknown function (PF09335) which is also found in bacterial DedA proteins and other eukaryotes. Mutation of a strictly conserved glycine residue within this domain inactivates Vmp1 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30785211 Tabara et al. 2019)]. Vmp1 is found on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is essential for the function of the contractile vacuole that protects cells from hypo-osmotic conditions and is also required for the initiation of development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18641456 Calvo-Garrido et al. 2008)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20009561 Calvo-Garrido et al. 2010)]. Regions of the ER containing phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) that usually generate autophagosomes are non-functional in ''vmp1'' null mutants, demonstrating a role for ''vmp1'' in modulating PtdIns3P signaling ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25131297 Calvo-Garrido et al. 2014)]. Vmp1 null mutants also have defects in growth and macropinocytosis, and contain accumulations of large ubiquitin-positive protein aggregates similar to those found in some neurodegenerative human diseases.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 01-MAR-2019 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0276455	Robert Dodson	G proteins are evolutionarily conserved heterotrimeric GTP binding proteins that can act as molecular switches. ''gpaG'' encodes G-alpha 7 that, together with the G-beta and G-gamma subunits ([/gene/DDB_G0277143 gpbA], [/gene/DDB_G0274125 gpgA]) associates with the gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor GrlE ([/gene/DDB_G0291356 grlE]). Overexpression of G-alpha 7 results in abnormal morphogenesis starting at the slug stage and spore differentiation factor 2 (SDF-2) production is abolished in ''gpaG'' null mutants [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1930158  (Wu and Devreotes 1991)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7949425  (Wu et al. 1994)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16672332  (Anjard and Loomis 2006)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19176583  (Anjard et al. 2009)]. Exogenous GABA induces release of AcbA ([/gene/DDB_G0270658 acbA]) so that it can be processed into the signal peptide SDF-2 that induces rapid sporulation. This signal transduction pathway depends on ''grlE'', ''gpaG'', ''pikA'', ([/gene/DDB_G0278727 pikA]) and ''pkgB'' ([/gene/DDB_G0290157 pkgB]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16672332  (Anjard and Loomis 2006)]. Cells carrying mutations in these genes do not form SDF-2.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 02-MAY-2019 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0285425	Robert Dodson	G proteins are evolutionarily conserved heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins that can act as molecular switches. ''gpaD'' encodes G-alpha 4 that is necessary for chemotaxis to folate during early development and associates with the steroid receptor GrlA ([/gene/DDB_G0271684 grlA]) during culmination [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1910174  (Hadwiger et al. 1991)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7937994  (Hadwiger, Lee and Firtel 1994)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19176583  (Anjard, Su and Loomis 2009)]. When fruiting body formation is nearly complete, the cells synthesize a steroid similar to hydrocortisone that stimulates release of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) which leads to secretion of AcbA ([/gene/DDB_G0270658 acbA]). The signal peptide spore differentiation factor 2 (SDF-2) is cleaved from AcbA and defuses throughout the sorus where it triggers rapid sporulation. Cells carrying null mutations in ''gpaD'' or ''grlA'' failed to generate SDF-2 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19176583  (Anjard, Su and Loomis 2009)]. Hadwiger and Firtel [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1730409  (Hadwiger and Firtel 1992)] found that cells lacking G-alpha 4 sporulated poorly unless they developed together with wild type cells. SDF-2 produced by wild type cells would be expected to result in sporulation of the mutant cells. It has been shown that loss of the internal cAMP phosphodiesterase RegA ([/gene/DDB_G0284331 regA]) suppresses the block to sporulation of ''gpaD'' null mutants [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24511612  (Schwebs et al. 2014)], In wild type cells, SDF-2 inhibits RegA allowing cAMP to accumulate and lead to spore formation.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 29-APR-2019 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis; annotation contributions: PMID:24511612 Jeff Hadwiger

DDB_G0269914	Robert Dodson	Dictyostelium tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (''tpp1'') was characterized and shown to have multiple functional similarities with its human ortholog (TPP1), mutations in which are responsible for Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (NCL), also known as Batten disease. Dictyostelium Tpp1 localizes to the lysosome. Cells lacking ''tpp1'' show reduced but not abolished ability to cleave a TPP1 substrate, precocious multicellular development, and a reduced ability to form spores. Starved ''tpp1'' null cells show intracellular auto-fluorescent bodies, and in response to amino acid starvation, ''tpp1'' null cells have reduced cell size and viability as compared to wild-type cells, suggesting that one function of Tpp1 may be to limit autophagy. In addition, cells lacking Tpp1 show strongly impaired development in the presence of the lysosome-perturbing drug chloroquine, and this phenotype can be suppressed by a secondary mutation in the gene ''stpA'' ([/gene/DDB_G0282973 stpA]), which encodes a protein with some similarity to mammalian oxysterol-binding proteins [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25540127  Phillips et al. 2015]. Tpp1 is upregulated and has a correlated increase in enzymatic activity in ''cln3'' null cells ([/gene/DDB_G0291157 cln3]) in response to osmotic stress [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30251676  (Mathavarajah et al. 2018)].<br />''tpp1'' antisense mutants in ''Dictyostelium'' resulted in accumulation of auto-fluorescent material, a characteristic trait of Batten disease. In addition, the antisense mutants exhibited deficiencies in growth and development, and increased rates of both phagocytosis and macropinocytosis. Antisense mutants of ''rheb'' ([/gene/DDB_G0277041 rheb]), the Ras GTPase that is an upstream activator of TOR signaling, phenocopied the Tpp1 mutants and overexpression of RheB rescued the defects caused by antisense inhibition of Tpp1, supporting a role for TOR signaling in Batten disease [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31100984  (Smith et al. 2019)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 01-OCT-2018 RD
DDB_G0289447	Robert Dodson	Besides ''mhcA'' ([/gene/DDB_G0286355 mhcA]) that encodes the classical myosin heavy chain, ''Dictyostelium'' carries genes for 12 unconventional myosins. The first 5 unconventional myosins ([/gene/DDB_G0280039 myoA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0289117 myoB]), ([/gene/DDB_G0276617 myoC]), ([/gene/DDB_G0275447 myoD]), ([/gene/DDB_G0288679 myoE]), were isolated from whole genome plasmid clones by low stringency probing with portions of the head region of ''mhcA''. The next 6 unconventional myosins ([/gene/DDB_G0289177 myoF]), ([/gene/DDB_G0276363 myoG]), ''myoH'', ([/gene/DDB_G0274455 myoI]), ([/gene/DDB_G0272112 myoJ]), ([/gene/DDB_G0274575 myoK]) were recognized in large YAC clones that represent the whole genome [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7937787  (Titus et al. 1994)]. Both MyoH and MyoJ have the domain structure of class-V unconventional myosins [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16857047  (Kollmar, 2006)] ''myoH'', ''myoI'' and ''myoK'' were found to lie in genomic regions within 500 kb of a pair of genes encoding actin, suggesting that they might have arisen as duplication of this 3 gene pattern. ''myoH'' mRNA accumulates dramatically only after 18 hrs of development suggesting that its product might have a role in culmination [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 02-SEP-2019 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0281545	Robert Dodson	Adenylyl cyclase increases more than 40 fold during the first 6 hours of development to generate the cAMP used as a chemoattractant ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/191758 Roos et al. 1977)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/183985 Klein 1976)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/108168 Loomis et al. 1978)]. ''acaA'' encodes a large protein (ACA) that is responsible for most of the adenylyl cyclase activity during aggregation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1348970 Pitt et al. 1992)]. However, ACA-generated cAMP wave ocsillations persist in later stages of development, and play a role later in aggregation, and slug formation and migration ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31044164 Singer et al. 2019)]. AcaA has two hydrophilic domains that can bind ATP and two sets of six transmembrane spans. There are two other adenylyl cyclase genes, ([/gene/DDB_G0267376 acrA]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0274569 acgA]), but they are not essential for chemotaxis; they function later in development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10556070 Soderbom et al. 1999)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1348970 Pitt et al. 1992)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8798577 van Es et al. 1996)]. <br />The activity of ACA is stimulated more than 5 fold when cAMP binds to the surface receptor CAR1 ([/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1], [/gene/DDB_G0273533 carA-2]), and stimulates dissociation of the trimeric G protein subunits, Galpha2 ([/gene/DDB_G0276267 gpaB]), and Gbeta/Ggamma ([/gene/DDB_G0277143 gpbA], [/gene/DDB_G0274125 gpgA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1333842 Pupillo et al. 1992)]. The signal transduction pathway includes membrane accumulation of PIP3 at the anterior so that the Cytosolic Regulator of Adenylyl Cyclase (CRAC) ([/gene/DDB_G0285161 dagA]) can bind and activate ACA ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8089184 Insall et al. 1994)]. Mutant cells in which this pathway is defective are unable to aggregrate chemotactically. Most of the cAMP that is synthesized by the activated ACA is secreted through an ATP dependent transporter, ([/gene/DDB_G0291714 abcB3]) to relay the signal ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25448698 Miranda et al. 2014)]. ACA is enriched in the uropod at the back of chemotactically migrating cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12600317 Kriebel et al. 2003)]. However, cAMP is not compartmentalized in the cytoplasm of actively chemotaxing cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19808889 Bagorda et al. 2009)]. <br />After aggregation, ACA is found predominately in prestalk cells at the tips of slugs ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11356026 Verkerke-van Wijk et al. 2001)]. The ''acaA'' gene is transcribed from 3 alternative promotors, and is also expressed in later developmental stages and in prespore cells. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20949015 Galardi-Castilla et al. 2010)]. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28057864  (Chen et al. 2017)] demonstrated a role for ACA in stalk cell differentiation. Their investigation into the c-di-GMP signal transduction pathway showed that the stalk-inducing signal cyclic diguanylate (c-di-cGMP) produced by diguanylate cyclase ([/gene/DDB_G0283453 dgcA]) activates cAMP synthesis by adenylate cyclase A (ACA) which is specifically expressed at the apical tip. cAMP then activates PKA ([/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC], [/gene/DDB_G0279413 pkaR]) which then triggers stalk differentiation.

DDB_G0271096	Robert Dodson	The ''atg7'' gene was isolated among several members of the autophagy family of genes, conserved from yeast to man. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12626495 Otto et al. 2003)]. Macroautophagy is used by eukaryotic cells to recycle non-essential cellular components during starvation and development. ''atg7'' null mutants grow normally, but survival during nitrogen starvation is reduced and development of the mutant is severely impaired. On bacterial lawns ''atg7'' mutant cells do not aggregate, but form multi-tipped aggregates on filters ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12626495 Otto et al. 2003)]. The multi-tipped phenotype of ''atg7'' mutants is similar to that of mutants in other autophagy genes atg6, ([/gene/DDB_G0269244 atg6A]) atg101, ([/gene/DDB_G0288287 atg101]) tipC, ([/gene/DDB_G0267422 tipC]) and tipD ([/gene/DDB_G0275323 tipD]). In yeast, the E1-like ATG7 protein has been shown to activate ATG12 in an ubiquitination-like reaction before conjugation with ATG5. This interaction was confirmed in ''Dictyostelium'' when the ATG5-ATG12 ([/gene/DDB_G0282929 atg12]) was found to be absent in ''atg7'' null mutants [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12626495  (Otto et al. 2003)] and further confirmed with the finding that ''Dictyostelium'' ATG12 recognizes ATG7 in 2-hybrid assays which suggests the formation of an E1-like complex ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26246495 Mesquita et al. 2015)]. Axenically grown ''atg7'' null cells plated on filters form aberrant fruiting bodies which do not produce viable, detergent-resistent spores. Wild-type cells in a chimaera do not rescue the developmental defects, showing that the ''atg7'' mutation is autonomous ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12626495 Otto et al. 2003)]. A screen for mutants defective in spore differentiation identified ''atg7'' as being essential for this process, and further analysis revealed that an ''atg7'' null mutant was specifically impaired in cAMP induction of prespore gene expression. Mutants lacking ''atg5'' ([/gene/DDB_G0289881 atg5]) and ''atg9'' ([/gene/DDB_G0285323 atg9]) have the same defect, indicating that autophagy is required for cAMP induction of prespore gene expression ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31051160 Yamada et al. 2019)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 09-DEC-2019 RD

Both of these proteins carry cellulose-binding domains and associate with cellulose in the extracellular matrix (ECM) deposited on the substratum by migrating slugs. Both ''st15 ''and ''ecmG'' mRNAs start to accumulate at 11 hours of development as the sheath is first being secreted ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420 Rosengarten et al. 2015)].

DDB_G0281211	Robert Dodson	The orphan GPCR receptor, ''far1'' has been identified as the ''D. discoideum'' folic acid receptor. fAR1 localizes to the cell surface and binds folic acid. Folic acid stimulation fails to trigger a phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate (PIP3) response and actin polymerization in ''far1'' null mutants. fAR1 controls both chemotaxis toward folic acid and phagocytosis of bacterial particles. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26906738 Pan et al. 2016)] In addition, ''far1'' null cells result in decreased intracellular killing of ingested K. pneumoniae, revealing the critical role of folate sensing in stimulating intracellular killing of bacteria ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28076662 Leiba et al. 2017)]. A different ''far1'' null mutant showed identical rates of phagocytosis to pHrodo-labelled live Bacillus subtilis as wt cells, but impaired chemotaxis, indicating that phagocytosis is not dependent on chemo-receptor sensing ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28541182 Meena et al. 2017)]. fAR1 was subsequently shown to detect bacterial secreted folate, for chasing bacteria, and to simultaneously detect the bacterial coat lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for engulfing and consuming them. ''far1'' null and gbeta null ([/gene/DDB_G0277143 gpbA]) cells displayed a significant decrease in bacterial internalization, and ERK2 ([/gene/DDB_G0283903 erkB]) signaling triggered by LPS is also impaired in ''far1'' and gbeta null cells. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29799847 Pan et al. 2018)] fAR1 has also been shown to mediate the inhibitory effect of folate on macropinocytosis upregulation.

DDB_G0271134	Robert Dodson	''celA'' encodes a secreted cellulase (endo-(1,4)-beta-D- glucanase) that is expressed in prespore cells as they start to encapsulate during culmination and later during germination when the enzyme is used to cut through the cellulose layer of the spore coat to allow amoebae to emerge [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1869562  (Blume and Ennis, 1991)]. The mRNA accumulates within 2 hrs following activation of germination during the swelling stage as well as during emergence of amoebae 3 hours later [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15470238  (Xu et al. 2004)]. Expression of ''celA'' in vegetative cells results in secretion of cellulase activity during growth. Expression of a modified ''celA'' with a deletion of the C-terminal region that includes 17 tandem copies of an unusual tetrapeptide repeat (TETP) and a cellulose binding domain also produces an extracellular cellulase activity [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1447151  (Ramalingam et al. 1992)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 04-OCT-2018 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

DDB_G0285161	Robert Dodson	The ''dagA'' gene product CRAC is required for positive regulation of adenylate cyclase activity ([/gene/DDB_G0281545 acaA]). The null mutant exhibits defects in chemotaxis and is unable to complete development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8089184 Insall et al. 1994]). Upon stimulation with cAMP, CRAC is translocated from the cytosolic to the membrane fraction. This translocation requires the G-protein beta subunit ([/gene/DDB_G0277143 gpbA]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7790361  (Lilly and Devreotes 1995)]. CRAC associates with the plasma membrane at the leading edge of the membrane through its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. This localized activation transmitted by the recruitment of cytosolic proteins leads to a localized response allowing the cells to move in the direction of the chemoattractant ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9778249 Parent et al. 1998]). DagA is involved in the signal transduction pathway responsible for AprA-dependent ([/gene/DDB_G0281663 aprA]) chemorepulsion.

Knockout of ''atg8b'' displayed only a mild develpmental phenotype, while ''atg8a'' mutants displayed a complex phenotype with delayed development, reduced growth, phagocytosis and cell viability, and an increase in ubiquitinylated proteins and a concomitant decrease in proteasomal activity. However knockout mutants of both genes displayed more severe phenotypes than the single ''atg8a'' mutant, indicating that both proteins function in parallel. Immunofluorescence analysis of knock-out strains suggests a crucial function for ATG8b in autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Atg8b localized around ATG8a and was presumably mainly present on the outer membrane of the autophagosome while Atg8a appears to be mainly associated with the inner membrane. These results suggest that Atg8b predominantly acts as adapter for the autophagy machinery at the outer and Atg8a as cargo receptor at the inner membrane of the autophagosome.

DDB_G0275009	Robert Dodson	The sequence and structure of the membrane bound guanylyl cyclase, GCA, encoded by ''gcA'', is similar to 12-transmembrane adenylyl cyclases, but the enzyme specifically catalyzes the synthesis of cGMP [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11237875  (Roelofs et al. 2001)]. Strains carrying null mutations in ''gcA'' aggregate and develop normally. ''In vivo'' GCA seems to account for less than 10% of the cAMP-induced cGMP and the remainder comes from the soluble guanylyl cyclase, sGC ([/gene/DDB_G0276269 sgcA]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11777934  (Roelofs and van Haastert 2002)]. Unlike the vertebrate guanylyl cyclases but similar to the adenylyl cyclase ACA, the Dictyostelium guanylyl cyclases are activated by receptor coupled heterotrimeric G-proteins [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15769639  (Schaap 2005)]. There may be relatively frequent conversion between adenylyl cyclases and guanylyl cyclases during evolution. Double mutants lacking both GCA and sGC have no measurable cGMP at any stage of development and yet show few defects in growth or development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11777934  (Roelofs and van Haastert 2002)]. GCA and sGC double mutants contain significant defects in chemotaxis to cAMP, but sGC rather than GCA is responsible for this phenotype [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18299345  (Veltman et al. 2008)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 13-DEC-2018 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0283419	Robert Dodson	G proteins are evolutionarily conserved heterotrimeric GTP binding proteins that can act as molecular switches within G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways. ''gpaI'' encodes the Galpha9 subunit that functions in signal transduction pathways that inhbit both growth and development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12176329  (Brzostowski et al. 2002)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19635129  (Bakthavatsalam et al. 2009)]. ''gpaI'' null mutants grow more rapidly and complete mound formation more quickly than wild type strains. Galpha9-dependent processes appear to limit the time of accumulation of PIP3, cAMP and cGMP following cAMP receptor stimulation during early development. Thus ''gpaI'' negatively regulates the PI3K/PTEN, adenylyl cyclase, and guanylyl cyclase signaling pathways and thereby regulates chemotaxis to cAMP [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15059962  (Brzostowski et al. 2004)]. During culmination, cells secrete high levels of glutamate that inhibit release of the SDF-2 precursor AcbA ([/gene/DDB_G0270658 acbA]). This inhibition is dependent on the Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor GrlE ([/gene/DDB_G0291356 grlE]) and the Galpha9 subunit [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16672332  (Anjard and Loomis 2006)]. GrlE also binds GABA but does so only when it is bound to G protein containing the Galpha7 ([/gene/DDB_G0276455 gpaG]) subunit [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19176583  (Anjard et al. 2009)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 24-DEC-2018 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0283755	Robert Dodson	''arpC'' encodes the 47 kDa actin-related subunit of the Arp2/3 complex [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11807934  (Insall et al. 2001)]. The seven subunits of this 200 kDa complex are encoded by ([/gene/DDB_G0277825 arcA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0282813 arcB]), ([/gene/DDB_G0292804 arcC]), ([/gene/DDB_G0269102 arcD]), ([/gene/DDB_G0288319 arcE]), ([/gene/DDB_G0272106 arpB]) and ''arpC''. The subunits of mammalian Arp2/3 are very similar to their ''Dictyostelium'' homologs. Arp2/3 binds to the side of F-actin filaments and initiates polymerization of a new F-actin chain at an angle of 70 degrees leading to a branched actin network that can alter the shape of cells. The ability to nucleate new actin filaments is greatly stimulated by direct interactions with members of the WASP/SCAR family [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11807934  (Insall et al. 2001)]. The Arp2/3 complex largely mediates the actin polymerization response to chemotactic stimulation and contributes to cell motility, pseudopod extension and adhesion in Dictyostelium chemotaxis. The complete Arp2/3 complex is essential for growth; partial loss of activity of either ArcB or ArpB impairs growth and chemotaxis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17553489  (Langridge and Kay, 2007)]. mRNA from each of the genes encoding Arp2/3 subunits accumulates coordinately to reach a peak at 3 hours of development and gradually decreases thereafter [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. The Arp2/3 complex interacts with the protein CARMIL, which serves as a scaffold for the assembly of a larger complex of proteins involved in the nucleation and termination of actin filament assembly. The complex consists of CARMIL ([/gene/DDB_G0292386 carmil]), AcpA, ([/gene/DDB_G0267374 acpA]) AcpB, ([/gene/DDB_G0272104 acpB]) the Arp2/3 complex, and type I myosins MyoB ([/gene/DDB_G0289117 myoB]) and MyoC ([/gene/DDB_G0276617 myoC]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11425877  (Jung et al. 2001)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 10-JUN-2019 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0284471	Robert Dodson	''kif8'' encodes a large protein (209 kDa) that belongs to a family of kinesins with multiple functions [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14641909  (Kollmar and Glockner 2003)]. The highly conserved motor domain is at the N- terminus. There are 7 WD-40 repeats at the C-terminus that make a seven-bladed beta propeller implicated in protein-protein interactions that could hold specific cargo to the molecular motor. Null mutants lacking Kif8 grow and develop normally. However, knocking out ''kif8'' suppresses the disruption of the interphase microtubule network and the formation of rockets that result from expression of a dominant-negative 380-kDa form of dynein ([/gene/DDB_G0276355 dhcA]). It appears that dynein and Kif8 cooperate in organizing the interphase microtubule distribution [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18430243  (Nag et al. 2008)]. ''kif8'' influences microtubule architecture. ''kif8'' null mutants have a less radial, more disorganized microtubule array and an increased average distance of the centrosome from the cell center. Kif9 localizes to the cytoplasm with no enrichment seen at microtubule tips [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31067156  (Odell et al. 2019)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 27-MAY-2019 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

ArpB is also a component of polyphosphate kinase that forms an actin-like fiber concurrent with the synthesis of a poly-phosphate chain in acidocalcisomes [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15496465  (Gomez-Garcia et al. 2004)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19344251  (Rao et al. 2009)].

DDB_G0271142	Robert Dodson	Profilins are small, well-conserved, actin-binding proteins that also bind other proteins as well as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Dictyostelium has three genes encoding profilin, ([/gene/DDB_G0287125 proA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0286187 proB]) and ''proC'' [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1725525  (Haugwitz et al. 1991)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17467078  (Arasada et al. 2007)]. ''proC'' is expressed in vegetative cells as well as during early development giving a peak of mRNA abundance at T=11 hrs but the abundance is much lower than for the mRNA of ''proA'' or ''proB'' [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. There is only 0.5% as much profilin III as profilin I or II at the start of development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17467078  (Arasada et al. 2007)]. For this reason it is unlikely that profilin III plays a significant role in sequestering actin. In contrast to profilin I or II, profilin III binds to vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) ([/gene/DDB_G0289541 vasP]) which is found at the tips of filopods and can nucleate actin polymerization. Profilin III is also found at the tips of filopods. Deletion of ''proC'' results in defects in chemotactic motility resulting from the formation of lateral pseudopods [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17467078  (Arasada et al. 2007)].

DDB_G0291352	Robert Dodson	''Dictyostelium'' contains orthologs of the core components of the presenilin/gamma-secretase complex: presenilin A ([/gene/DDB_G0291352 psenA]), presenilin B ([/gene/DDB_G0292310 psenB]), Aph-1 ([/gene/DDB_G0267976 aph1]) and nicastrin ([/gene/DDB_G0287801 ncstn]) which are capable of amyloidogenic processing of ectopically expressed human amyloid precursor protein (APP) to generate amyloid-beta peptides. Gamma-secretase activity is required for phagocytosis in Dictyostelium, and gamma-secretase mutants have primary defects in pre-spore/spore differentiation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20699477  (McMains et al. 2010)]. A double null mutant lacking both presenilin A and presenilin B genes is blocked at the aggregation stage prior to morphogenesis. Either PsenB or human Psen1 can rescue the developmental phenotype of this mutant. In addition, presenilin loss in Dictyostelium results in elevated cAMP levels and enhanced stimulation-induced calcium release, suggesting that presenilins regulate these intracellular signalling pathways. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24463814  (Ludtmann et al. 2014)]. ''Dictyostelium'' orthologs of the gamma-secretase complex PsenA, PsenB, Aph-1, and Nicastrin are necessary for macropinocytosis, phagocytosis, and autophagy, indicating roles in a general defect in lysosomal trafficking and degradation. In addition, loss of psenA/psenB and Aph-1 leads to an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, suggesting impaired protein degradation in these mutants. All of the endocytic defects in PSEN ortholog mutants can be fully restored by proteolytically inactive ''Dictyostelium'' PsenB and human PSEN1, demonstrating an evolutionarily conserved non-proteolytic role for presenilin in lysosomal trafficking and autophagy.

''gefF'' is expressed throughout growth and development, with maximum expression at 4 hours. Attempts to knock out ''gefF'' were unsuccessful suggesting that it plays an essential role ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16086850 Wilkins et al. 2005)]. Gain-of-function experiments show that macropinocytosis is stimulated by persistent Ras activation and genetic analysis suggests that RasG ([/gene/DDB_G0293434 rasG]) and RasS ([/gene/DDB_G0283537 rasS]) are the key Ras proteins involved. GefF has GEF activity towards RasG (unpublished results, cited in [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967009 Williams et al. 2019)]. GefF normally localizes to macropinocytic cups, but is unable to do so in a ''gefF'' knock-in mutant. In addition, a ''gefF'' insertional mutant is defective in fluid phase uptake and macropinosome formation, revealing a role for ''gefF'' in macropinocytosis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967009 Williams et al. 2019)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 06-APR-2021 RD

The mutant slugs are also defective in thermotaxis, displaying an insensitivity to temperature gradients. However, growth, morphology and fruiting body morphology are normal in ''gefL'' null mutants ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16086850 Wilkins et al. 2005)].

After dephosphorylation, the ribose moiety is removed to generate the cytokinin isopentenyl adenine that can be further modified to make the germination inhibitor, discadenine ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/566219 Taya et al. 1978)]. Isopentenyl adenine is also generated by post-transcriptional addition of an isopentenyl group to adenosine groups in tRNA. ''iptA'' encodes the condensing enzyme while iptB ([/gene/DDB_G0291528 iptB]) and iptC ([/gene/DDB_G0273039 iptC-1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0274017 iptC-2]) encode homologs of transferases that modify tRNA ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18216168 Anjard and Loomis et al. 2008)]. Mutants lacking IptA have less than 10% of the wild type level of isopentenyl adenine or discadenine during culmination and sporulate poorly. The phenotype is non-cell autonomous as expected from the ability of secreted cytokinins to induce sporulation. Cellular responses to cytokinins depend on a two component system that includes the adenylyl cyclase with a receiver domain, ACR, ([/gene/DDB_G0267376 acrA]) and the histidine kinase, DhkB, ([/gene/DDB_G0277845 dhkB]) but not the H2 intermediate, RdeA ([/gene/DDB_G0282923 rdeA]). It appears that cytokinins activate adenylyl cyclase activity by direct phosphorelay from DhkB to ACR ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18216168 Anjard and Loomis et al. 2008)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 20-JAN-2017 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

DDB_G0283903	Robert Dodson	''erkB'' encodes a MAP kinase that is essential for aggregation and cAMP relay ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7844154 Segall et al. 1995)]. The protein kinase activity is stimulated by cAMP binding to CAR1 ([/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0273533 carA-2]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8631932 Maeda et al. 1996)]. ERK2 associates with and reversibly inhibits RegA ([/gene/DDB_G0284331 regA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31730032 Adhikari et al. 2019)] which reduces the turnover of internal cAMP such that it can accumulate and activate PKA ([/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC]), ([/gene/DDB_G0279413 pkaR]). A feedback loop in which PKA activity inhibits ERK2 inhibition of RegA leads to an increase in cAMP phosphodiesterase activity that reduces the concentration of cAMP. As a result of this circuit and the activation of adenylyl cyclase when cAMP binds to CAR1, cAMP oscillates with a period of about 6 minutes during early aggregation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9843585 Laub and Loomis et al. 1998)] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15131307 Maeda et al. 2004)]. Stochastic noise and synchronization make these oscillations robust ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17997595 Kim et al. 2007)]. ERK2 was also found to associate with Galpha4 ([/gene/DDB_G0285425 gpaD]) which is generated in response to folate. Activated ERK2 also appears to have a function in morphogenesis during culmination ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19765570 Nguyen and Hadwiger et al. 2009)]. A phosphoproteomics analysis revealed a core set of around 80 proteins that are phosphorylated by ''erkB'' in response to different chemoattractants. Many of the phosphorylated proteins are themselves other signaling proteins, revealing a central role for ''erkB'' in regulating chemotaxis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612939 Nichols et al. 2018)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 11-DEC-2015 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0289987	Robert Dodson	Puf118 is a member of the PUF family of evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding proteins related to ''Drosophila'' Pumilio. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29118357 Hotz et al. 2017)] show that proteins from each of the four chemotaxis signaling pathways ([/gene/DDB_G0292592 lst8]), ([/gene/DDB_G0268548 pikF]), ([/gene/DDB_G0278525 plaA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0276269 sgcA]) are all localized to the cell front, and that their distribution is dependent on the mRNA-binding protein Puf118 that binds and localizes their mRNAs to the front of migrating cells. This reveals a common mechanism for coordinating the localization of these pathways at the cell front during directed chemotactic cell migration.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 14-NOV-2017 RD
DDB_G0270756	Robert Dodson	GATA transcription factors specifically bind the DNA sequence (A/T)GATA(A/G) in the regulatory regions of genes [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2249770  (Yamamoto et al. 1990)]. In ''Dictyostelium'', there are 24 predicted proteins that contain GATA-type zinc fingers: [/gene/DDB_G0277147 stkA], [/gene/DDB_G0280547 comH], [/gene/DDB_G0277589 gtaC], [/gene/DDB_G0286855 gtaD],[/gene/DDB_G0267640 gtaE],[/gene/DDB_G0268792 gtaF],[/gene/DDB_G0270756 gtaG],[/gene/DDB_G0277591 gtaH],[/gene/DDB_G0281661 gtaI],[/gene/DDB_G0281829 gtaJ],[/gene/DDB_G0282811 gtaK],[/gene/DDB_G0285139 gtaL],[/gene/DDB_G0286837 gtaM],[/gene/DDB_G0287057 gtaN],[/gene/DDB_G0289651 gtaO],[/gene/DDB_G0295707 gtaP],[/gene/DDB_G0286843 gtaQ],[/gene/DDB_G0279331 gtaR],[/gene/DDB_G0280627 gtaS],[/gene/DDB_G0280639 gtaT],[/gene/DDB_G0280853 gtaU],[/gene/DDB_G0281087 gtaV],[/gene/DDB_G0286839 gtaW], [/gene/DDB_G0290665 gtaX], as well as [/gene/DDB_G0279239 gtaY], which is missing a cysteine residue. <br />''gtaG'' is expressed in prestalk cells. Knockout mutants fails to progress beyond the finger stage of development and fruiting body formation is greatly compromised, revealing that ''gtaG'' is essential for terminal differentiation in ''Dictostelium''. Transcriptome anaylsis reveals that GtaG regulates prestalk gene expression, and that its activity overlaps with that of the well characterized transcription factor, Dd-STATa ([/gene/DDB_G0281381 dstA]). GtaG activity appears to be mediated by regulation of cyclic di-GMP and Spore Differentiation Factor-1 production [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26962009  (Katoh-Kurasawa et al. 2016)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 22-JAN-2018 RD

DDB_G0273919	Petra Fey	The lectin Discoidin I binds N-acetylgalactosamine and galactose [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4517669  (Rosen et al. 1973)]. Discoidin I subunits associate to form a tetramer [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4858710  (Simpson et al. 1974)] and are expressed from a family of 3 different genes: ''dscA'', ''dscC'' ([/gene/DDB_G0273065 dscC-1]) ([/gene/DDB_G0273885 dscC-2]) and ''dscD'' ([/gene/DDB_G0273067 dscD-1]) ([/gene/DDB_G0273887 dscD-2]). [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6279874  (Poole et al. 1981)]. Monomeric discoidin I is located mainly in the cytosol, while the tetrameric form of discoidin I is detected in multilamellar bodies and is externalized during aggregation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2581974  (Barondes et al. 1985)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8416797  (Fukuzawa et al. 1993)]. Discoidin I gene expression is induced by prestarvation factor (PSF) and conditioned medium factor, ([/gene/DDB_G0275007 cmfA]) but is down-regulated by cAMP [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7641976  (Blusch et al. 1995)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2049883  (Rathi et al. 1991)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1663029  (Gomer et al. 1991)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2196444  (Vauti et al. 1990)]. Mutants defective in discoidin I fail to stream during aggregation, implicating discoidin I in cell-substrate adhesion [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6509552  (Springer et al. 1984)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4075402  (Crowley et al. 1985)]. In addition, discoidin I is thought to play an intracellular role, as mutants in which discoidin genes are not expressed also have an abnormally centered microtubule organizing center and more rounded cell morphology, suggesting a role for discoidins in cytoskeleton organization during aggregation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1334012  (Alexander et al. 1992)]. <br />''Dictyostelium discoideum'' strains that carry bacteria secrete approx. 80 times higher levels of DscA and DscC than non-carriers. Secreted DscA binds to ''Klebsiella pneumoniae''. DscA binding protects bacteria from extracellular killing, promotes their internalization and prolongs their retention in both ''Dictyostelium discoideum'' and mammalian cells. Plant lectins induce the same response, suggesting that modified uptake and persistence of lectin-coated bacteria in eukaryotic cells is a general phenomenon, termed lectin-induced modified bacterial internalization [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30049880  (Dinh et al. 2018)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 10-AUG-2018 RD
DDB_G0293526	Robert Dodson	''racC'' encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Rho family of small GTPases. G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Ras GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. GxcT ([/gene/DDB_G0269610 gxcT]) binds RacC and is a likely GEF for RacC ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24248334 Wang et al. 2013]). The armadillo-like protein Darlin ([/gene/DDB_G0288771 darA]) binds RacC, but GEF activity has not been demonstrated ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9802899 Vithalani et al. 1998]). Additional possible GEFs for RacC include DockD ([/gene/DDB_G0284725 docD]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19037099 Para et al. 2009]), ZizB ([/gene/DDB_G0293084 zizB]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22366457 Pakes et al. 2012]), gxcDD ([/gene/DDB_G0279733 gxcDD]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17584488 Mondal et al. 2007]) and GxcC ([/gene/DDB_G0284845 gxcC]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23363311 Plak et al. 2013]). DRG ([/gene/DDB_G0291978 xacA]) contains both GAP and GEF domains, and DRG displays weak GAP activity for RacC ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9188459 Ludbrook et al. 1997]). Other possible GAPs for RacC include GAPA ([/gene/DDB_G0269140 gapA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21085675 Mondal et al. 2010]) and DGAP1 ([/gene/DDB_G0287585 rgaA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22302991 Filic et al. 2012]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26940518 Rivero et al. 2016]). <br />RacC has multiple binding partners that may function as downstream effectors. These include: the myosin heavy chain kinase PakB ([/gene/DDB_G0276459 pakB]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15509655 de la Roche et al. 2005]), PakC ([/gene/DDB_G0267450 pakC]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15470506 Park et al. 2004]), coronin A ([/gene/DDB_G0267382 corA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24347642 Swaminathan et al. 2013]), WASP ([/gene/DDB_G0293834 wasA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16968699 Han et al. 2006]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31786060 Amato et al. 2019)] and WASP-B ([/gene/DDB_G0272811 wasB]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23791739  (Chung et al. 2013)]. RacC also binds to the Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor RhoGDI1 ([/gene/DDB_G0291077 rdiA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12163018 Imai et al. 2002]). <br />''racC'' plays an important role in signaling networks that regulate F-actin assembly during ''Dictyostelium'' chemotaxis and other processes that depend on the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. ''racC'' is expressed during growth, but ''racC'' mRNA levels decrease significantly during aggregation before again increasing late during development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8294042 Bush et al. 1993]). ''racC'' overexpression results in aberrant F-actin organization with cells displaying unusual dorsal and peripheral F-actin rich surface blebs. Overexpression of ''racC'' also results in increased rates of phagocytosis, but a decrease in macropinocytosis and exocytosis rates ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9763450 Seastone et al. 1998]). ''racC'' is activated at the leading edge of chemotaxing cells where it binds and activates WASP. ''racC'' null mutants have defects in both chemotaxis and cytokinesis, and in addition display decreased levels of F-actin polymerization and reduced PI3K ([/gene/DDB_G0278727 pikA], [/gene/DDB_G0283081 pikB]) activation and translocation to the membrane in response to cAMP stimulation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16968699 Han et al. 2006]). RasC is aberrantly localized in ''wasB'' null cells, and these mutants also have higher levels of activated RacC, suggesting that WASP-B plays a role in the regulation of actin polymerization by modulating the activity and localization of RacC ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23791739 Chung et al. 2013]). ''racC'' null cells also have a streaming defect, forming smaller and more fragmented streams. The adenylate cyclase ACA ([/gene/DDB_G0281545 acaA]), which is normally enriched in the uropod at the back of chemotactically migrating cells, is mainly associated with intracellular vesicular structures in ''racC'' null cells, revealing an important role for RacC in the regulation of ACA localization ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26315268 Wang et al. 2015]). The cell proliferation repressor AprA ([/gene/DDB_G0281663 aprA]) requires RacC to induce chemo-repulsion revealing that ''racC'' also plays a role in chemo-repulsion signal transduction pathways ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30462573 Rijal et al. 2018]). Activated Rac1A ([/gene/DDB_G0277869 rac1A]) and RacC both regulate, and are regulated by, WASP. WASP interacts with activated Rac genes via its CRIB motif, and this interaction is required for WASP to generate pseudopods in the absence of SCAR/WAVE ([/gene/DDB_G0285253 scrA]). However, this interaction also provides a means for WASP to remove activated Racs from the membrane via endocytosis. Thus, WASP contributes to front-rear cell polarity by controlling localization and cellular levels of activated Rac.

DDB_G0288375	Robert Dodson	The 47 kDa protein encoded by ''lis1'' is a close homolog of mammalian LIS1 which is associated with lissencephaly. ''lis1'' consists of an N-terminal LIS1-homology domain and seven WD40 repreats. Like LIS1, it is found at the tips of microtubules where it asssociates with the XMAP215 family member DdCP224 ([/gene/DDB_G0268616 cepJ]) and dynein ([/gene/DDB_G0276355 dhcA]) to form cortical attachments. Partial loss of Lis1 function resulting from a hypomorphic point mutation leads to collapse of radial interphase microtubule arrays into bundles that whorl around the nucleus. Lis1 is also found directly assocated with the centrosome which it helps localize near the nucleus. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15800059  (Rehberg et al. 2005)]. LIS1 may also affect actin dynamics through interactions with Rac1A ([/gene/DDB_G0277869 rac1A]) and doublecortin ([/gene/DDB_G0277115 dcx]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21034843  (Meyer et al. 2010)]. LIS1 over-expression mutants have a defect in the formation of the phagocytic cup and a reduced migration velocity, further suggesting that LIS1 is involved in the regulation of actin dynamics [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32524725  (Chhatre et al. 2020)]. About 100 different proteins contribute to centrosomal functions including the products of ([/gene/DDB_G0271738 tubC]), ([/gene/DDB_G0285849 spc97]), ([/gene/DDB_G0283909 spc98]), ([/gene/DDB_G0288427 cenA]), ''lis1'', ([/gene/DDB_G0270814 nek2]), ([/gene/DDB_G0283607 eb1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0268616 cepJ]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0278809 cepG]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15548420  (Graf et al. 2004)].

DDB_G0272192	Petra Fey	The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs), commonly known as Batten disease, belong to a group of neurological disorders causing blindness, seizures, loss of motor function and cognitive ability, and premature death. ''Dictyostelium'' Mfsd8 is a homolog of human MFSD8 (CLN7), identified as one of the mutated genes in the disease. Conserved key residues, protein domains and a structural model greatly overlap between both, the human and and ''Dictyostelium'' protein. Mfsd8 proteins contain multiple transmembrane domains. <br />GFP-fusions show that Mfsd8 localizes to endsomal compartments and acidic vesicles, including late endosomes. Mass spectrometry has been used to reveal the Mfsd8 interactive. Among the interacting proteins cathepsin D has been independently verified ([/gene/DDB_G0279411 ctsD]). Other interacting candidates are [/gene/DDB_G0285793 cadA] or [/gene/DDB_G0281605 cfaD]. The three proteins also interact with Cln5 ([/gene/DDB_G0275299 cln5]) suggesting a NCL protein network. The ''mfsd8'' null mutant is involved in protein secretion. During starvation, intracellular levels of CtsD and Cln5 are reduced compared to wild-type. Because expression levels are not affected by the mutation, conditioned starvation buffer has been tested for the proteins and elevated levels found. Thus Mfsd8 negatively regulates secretion of CtsD and Cln5 during starvation )[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32087303 Huber et al. 2020]). Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 21-JUL-2020 PF

Two-hybrid assays reveal that PakB interacts with the Rho family GTPases ([/gene/DDB_G0286555 racA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0279605 racB]) , ([/gene/DDB_G0293526 racC]), ([/gene/DDB_G0269176 racF1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0277869 rac1A]) , ([/gene/DDB_G0268622 rac1B]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0282365 rac1C]). PakB is enriched at the leading edge of migrating cells and at phagocytic cups. ''pakB'' null cells displayed no significant behavioral defects, but cells expressing activated PakB were unable to complete cytokinesis when grown in suspension and exhibited increased rates of phagocytosis and pinocytosis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15509655  (de la Roche et al. 2005)]. PakB interacts with the SH3 domain of the actin-binding protein AbpE (Abp1). ([/gene/DDB_G0273447 abpE-1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0273517 abpE-2]) and significantly enhances the binding of AbpE to actin filaments. When overexpressed in PakB- null cells, AbpE completely blocks early development at the aggregation stage, prevents cell polarization, and significantly reduces chemotaxis rates.

DDB_G0283907	Robert Dodson	''pkaC'' encodes the catalytic subunit of the cAMP dependent protein kinase PKA ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1332055 Mann et al. 1992 ], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8373760 Anjard et al. 1993)]. In the absence of cAMP, PKA ([/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC], [/gene/DDB_G0279413 pkaR]) exists as an inactive complex of the catalytic and regulatory subunits. cAMP binds cooperatively to two sites on PkaR which leads to the release of active PkaC. This protein kinase plays multiple roles throughout development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1728597 Harwood et al. 1992], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9126295 Mann et al. 1997], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9729606 Loomis et al. 1998], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25872182 Loomis et al. 2015]). During normal development on a moist surface, mRNA from ''pkaC'' increases smoothly from an initially low level to reach a peak at 20 hours ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420 Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. When cells are developed in suspension with addition of 50 nM cAMP every 6 minutes, the level of ''pkaC'' mRNA stays low throughout development. Very few other genes are repressed by cAMP pulses. The regulatory subunit can reassociate with the catalytic subunit and inhibit it when the phosphodiesterase RegA ([/gene/DDB_G0284331 regA]) hydrolyses cAMP bound to PkaR ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9435289 Shaulsky et al. 1998], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20923972 Moorthy et al. 2011)]. As part of the circuit that generates 6 minute oscillations in cAMP during aggregation, PKA activity blocks ERK2 ([/gene/DDB_G0283903 erkB]) inhibition of RegA as well as CRAC ([/gene/DDB_G0285161 dagA]) activation of ACA ([/gene/DDB_G0281545 acaA]) resulting in rapid decrease in the internal concentration of cAMP and a drop in PKA activity ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9020088 Aubry et al. 1997], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9843585 Laub and Loomis et al. 1998], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15131307 Maeda et al. 2004]). PKA plays a role in gradient sensing and chemotaxis to cAMP by regulating the Ras ([/gene/DDB_G0281385 rasC], [/gene/DDB_G0293434 rasG]), Rap1 ([/gene/DDB_G0291237 rapA]) and TORC2 ([/gene/DDB_G0281569 tor]) signaling pathways in response to cAMP. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28302905 Scavello et al. 2017)]. PKA is also part of the signal transduction pathway by which Prestarvation Factor (PSF) stimulates expression of ''carA'' ([/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1], [/gene/DDB_G0273533 carA-2]) and ''acaA'' at the initiation of development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9584128 Souza et al. 1998)]. PSF activates the protein kinase YakA ([/gene/DDB_G0283605 yakA]) such that it inhibits PufA ([/gene/DDB_G0279735 pufA]) which is the translational inhibitor of ''pkaC'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10375515 Souza et al. 1999)]. PkaC increases relative to PkaR resulting in constitutive protein kinase activity. PKA also controls gene expression during culmination by regulating the transcription factor SrfA ([/gene/DDB_G0281387 srfA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12204259 Escalante et al. 2002)]. The peptide signal that prepares prespore and prestalk cells for terminal differentiation, SDF-1, is phosphorylated by PKA ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9373946 Anjard et al. 1997)]. <br />[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28057864  (Chen et al. 2017)] demonstrated a role for PKA in stalk cell differentiation. Their investigation into the c-di-GMP signal transduction pathway showed that the stalk-inducing signal cyclic diguanylate (c-di-cGMP) produced by diguanylate cyclase ([/gene/DDB_G0283453 dgcA]) activates cAMP synthesis by adenylate cyclase A (ACA) which is specifically expressed at the apical tip. cAMP then activates PKA which then triggers stalk differentiation. PKA ([/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC], [/gene/DDB_G0279413 pkaR]) also mediates the response of several xenobiotic compounds, including valproic acid, a treatment for bipolar disorder, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16759735  (Boeckeler et al. 2006)] and curcumin [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29135990  (Swatson et al. 2017)]. Results presented in ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29440238 Williams et al. 2018)] argue that macropinocytosis is downregulated in early development because of PKA activation. PkaC is involved in the signal transduction pathway responsible for AprA-dependent ([/gene/DDB_G0281663 aprA]) chemorepulsion.

It is found associated with vacuole membrane protein 1 ([/gene/DDB_G0285175 vmp1]) on specialized regions of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) enriched in phosphatidylinositol-3-P (PtdIns3P) that give rise to autophagosomes ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22024750 King et al. 2011)]. Cells lacking Vmp1 have elevated and aberrant PtdIns3P signaling on the ER, resulting in an increased and persistent recruitment of ATG18 and other autophagic proteins.

DDB_G0280849	Robert Dodson	''dicA'' encodes the highly conserved dynein intermediate chain that associates with dynein heavy chains ([/gene/DDB_G0276355 dhcA]) to make the motor complexes which function in retrograd transport of cargos along microtubules [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1469051  (Koonce et al. 1992)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7866389  (Koonce et al. 1994)]. An N-terminal region of DicA binds the dynactin complex that allows dynein to move organelles long distances along microtubules. A C-terminal region of DicA binds dynein heavy chain. Expression of truncated versions of ''dicA'' missing either the N-terminal region or the C-terminal region results in mislocalization of the Golgi, collapse of microtubules into large bundles, and alterations in centrosome separation resulting in defective mitosis. It appears that dynactin-mediated dynein function is required for organization of interphase microtubule network as well as centrosome replication and separation. As expected, dynein intermediate chain is essential for viability of ''Dictyostelium'' [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10601339  (Ma et al. 1999)]. Dynein motors cluster into microdomains on phagosomal membranes, resulting in rapid directed transport of the phagosome toward microtubule minus ends, likely promoting phagolysosome fusion and pathogen degradation.

DDB_G0276355	Robert Dodson	''dhcA'' encodes the highly conserved dynein heavy chain that together with the dynein intermediate chain ([/gene/DDB_G0280849 dicA]) makes motor complexes that move cargo along microtubules [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1469051  (Koonce et al. 1992)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7866389  (Koonce et al. 1994)]. The heavy chain has a stem at the N-terminal that binds cargo, followed by the motor domain, 4 ATP binding sites and a long stalk ending in a microtubule binding site [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22398446  (Kon et al. 2012)]. Dimers walk along microtubules towards the minus-ends by coupling large structural changes to ATP [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17548361  (Mogami et al. 2007)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19203583  (Roberts et al. 2009)]. Endosomes are transported along microtubules with frequent reversals in direction due to a tug-of-war between dynein pulling to the minus-end and kinesin ([/gene/DDB_G0290963 kif1]) pulling to the plus-end [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19864630  (Soppina et al. 2009)]. Dynein heavy chains are essential for viability of ''Dictyostelium'' [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9453714  (Koonce and Knecht, 1998)]. ''In vitro'' assays of mutant forms of dynein heavy chain showed that the first ATP-binding/hydrolysis site is essential for the motor activities. Mutations in the second and fourth binding sites reduced microtubule-activated ATPase activity but had no effect on binding affinity. Mutations in the third binding site resulted in 20-fold slower sliding velocity on microtubules [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15366936  (Kon et al. 2004)]. Overexpression of a truncated 380 kDa form lacking the amino terminal region involved in dimerization results in collapse of the interphase radial microtubule array [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8816999  (Koonce and Samso, 1996)]. Dynein is also found associated with centrosomes [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15186508  (Hestermann et al. 2004)]. Dynein motors cluster into microdomains on phagosomal membranes, resulting in rapid directed transport of the phagosome toward microtubule minus ends, likely promoting phagolysosome fusion and pathogen degradation.

DDB_G0285849	Robert Dodson	Spc97 and Spc98 ([/gene/DDB_G0283909 spc98]), form a complex with gamma-tubulin ([/gene/DDB_G0271738 tubC]) that initiates microtubule polymerization in the spindle pole body of yeast. The ''Dictyostelium'' homologs are encoded by ''spc97'' and ''spc98'', respectively. Throughout the cell cycle they are found in the centrosome which functions as the main microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12018385  (Daunderer and Graf, 2002)]. Under high salt conditions Spc98 co-immunoprecipitates with gamma-tubulin but Spc97 fails to co-immunoprecipitate. In other organisms all 3 proteins are strongly held in a complex. In contrast to mammalian cells, there is no dramatic increase in microtubule nucleation during mitosis of ''Dictyostelium''. At prometaphase the gamma-tubulin/Spc98 complex rapidly redistributes from the centrosomal corona to the inner surfaces of the two outer layers of the centrosome allowing the microtubule spindle to drive the two spindle poles apart [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9880333  (Ueda et al. 1999)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12018385  (Daunderer and Graf, 2002)]. Functional microtubule-nucleating units may be formed when Spc97 associates with the gamma-tubulin/Spc98 complex. About 100 different proteins contribute to centrosomal functions including the products of ''tubC'', ''spc97'', ([/gene/DDB_G0283909 spc98]), ([/gene/DDB_G0288427 cenA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0288375 lis1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0270814 nek2]), ([/gene/DDB_G0283607 eb1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0268616 cepJ]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0278809 cepG]).

DDB_G0289121	Robert Dodson	''pde4'' encodes a type 1 phosphodiesterase which participates along with PdsA ([/gene/DDB_G0285995 pdsA]) in breaking down extracellular cAMP during the slug stage. Pde4 has a lower affinity for cAMP than PdsA but accounts for most of the extracellular activity after aggregation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16644729  (Bader et al. 2006)],[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17040207  (Bader et al. 2007)]. A signal sequence for secretion of Pde4 across membranes occurs at the N-terminus followed by two transmembrane domains that leave the catalytic domain in the extracellular environment. ''pde4'' is not expressed in growing cells or during early development but is active between 6 and 16 hours of development. This transcriptional pattern is identical to that of ''pdeE'' ([/gene/DDB_G0276027 pdeE]) which encodes an internal cAMP phosphodiesterase found at the slug stage [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. Deletion of ''pde4'' results in mutant strains that aggregate normally but then are arrested at the mound stage [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16644729  (Bader et al. 2006)]. It appears that Pde4 controls the extracellular levels of cAMP that regulate morphogenesis in mounds and slugs.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 07-NOV-2018 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

DDB_G0291157	Robert Dodson	''Dictyostelium'' ''cln3'' is the ortholog of human CLN3, which is linked to a juvenile form of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), also referred to as Batten disease. Cln3 localizes primarily to the contractile vacuole system and to a smaller extent, compartments of the endocytic pathway and the Golgi complex. ''cln3'' null mutants display reduced adhesion during the early stages of development, which delays streaming and aggregation. Mid-to-late stage development of ''cln3'' null cells is precocious. Extracellular levels of the autocrine proliferation repressor AprA ([/gene/DDB_G0281663 aprA]) and the calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion protein CadA ([/gene/DDB_G0285793 cadA]) are also altered in ''cln3'' mutants [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25330233  (Huber et al. 2014)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27669405  (Huber et al. 2016)]. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed differences in the protein content of conditioned media (CM) from cln3 null cells compared to wt, which establishes a role for Cln3 in protein secretion. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28365442  (Huber 2017)]. The absence or significant reduction of cell adhesion-related protein CsbA ([/gene/DDB_G0272833 csbA]), cell motility-related protein PsiM ([/gene/DDB_G0284759 psiM]) and density sensing factor CMF ([/gene/DDB_G0275007 cmfA]) in ''cln3'' null CM may help explain the adhesion and aggregation phenotypes. Other proteins involved in endocytosis, vesicle-mediated transport and proteolysis were either increased or found exclusively in the CM from ''cln3'' null cells. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28365442  (Huber 2017)]. Cln3 also plays a role in osmoregulation. Cln3 localizes to the contractile vacuole system during mitosis, and ''cln3'' null cells display defects in cytokinesis. The recovery of ''cln3'' null cells from hypotonic stress is delayed, and during hypertonic stress, ''cln3'' null cells have reduced cell viability and inhibited development. In addition, Cln3-deficiency during osmotic stress upregulates the expression of tpp1 ([/gene/DDB_G0269914 tpp1]), the ''Dictyostelium'' ortholog of TPP1/CLN2, which has been implicated in Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30251676  (Mathavarajah et al. 2018)]. During starvation, a comparative transcriptomics RNA-seq analysis revealed 1153 genes differentially expressed in ''cln3'' null cells compared to wild type. In addition to supporting previous findings regarding the roles of ''cln3'', results also show that loss of ''cln3'' affects the expression and activity of lysosomal enzymes, increases endo-lysosomal pH, and alters nitric oxide homeostasis. During starvation, ''cln3'' null cells also accumulate autofluorescent storage bodies, which is the hallmark of Batten disease [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30771446  (Huber et al. 2019)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 24-MAY-2019 RD; annotation contributions: PMID:25330233, Robert Huber

DDB_G0291123	Robert Dodson	Peptide sequences from purified glycogen phosphorylase (gp2) were used to clone ''glpD'' [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1310312  (Rutherford et al. 1992)]. The deduced amino acid sequence of GlpD was found to be 47% identical to mammalian glycogen phosphorylase. ''glpD'' mRNA starts to accumulate after 6 hours of development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. The ''glpD'' gene is expressed in both prestalk and prespore cells and can be induced by both cAMP and DIF-1. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8026640  (Rogers et al. 1994)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8026327  (Yin et al. 1994)]. Inactivation of ''glpD'' by homologous recombination did not significantly affect growth or development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8026640  (Rogers et al. 1994)]. A separate glycogen phosphorylase gene, ([/gene/DDB_G0281383 glpV]), encodes a protein which is 57% identical in amino acid sequence to GlpD, but which is found exclusively in prestalk cells at the slug stage. However, in ''glpD'' null mutants, ''glpV'' is expressed in both prespore and prestalk cells, which accounts for the lack of significant affects due to the loss of ''glpD''. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8026640  (Rogers et al. 1994)].

They have been identified in most if not all phyla of eukaryotes. Inmetazoans, homeobox-containing proteins are known to be involvedin regulating the anterior-posterior body plan and in the specification of certain cell types and anterior-posterior compartments (see [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9486804 Han and Firtel 1998] and references therein).

''hbx9'' is expressed in the anterior portion of prestalk cells. ''hbx9'' null cells display several phenotypes: decreased cell proliferation, cell-cell adhesion, chemotaxis to cAMP and a delay in the onset of aggregation. In ''hbx9'' null cells proportioning and patterning is altered in favor of the pstA cell type. In addition, ''hbx9'' null cells have reduced expression of genes involved in cAMP signaling, including yakA ([/gene/DDB_G0283605 yakA]), acaA ([/gene/DDB_G0281545 acaA]), carA ([/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1], [/gene/DDB_G0273533 carA-2]) and others suggesting that Hbx9 controls cell proportioning of prestalk cells by modulating cAMP signalling during the growth-to-development transition ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28027501 Mishra et al. 2016)].'''Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 23-FEB-2017 RD'''

DDB_G0285793	Petra Fey	''cadA'' encodes the glycoprotein gp24 or DdCAD-1 that has been implicated in cell-cell adhesion during early development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3569662  (Knecht et al., 1987]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8663243  Wong et al., 1996)]. It is synthesized in the cytoplasm and transported to the plasma membrane by contractile vacuoles [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9265658  (Sesaki et al., 1997)]. DdCAD-1 binds Ca(2+) activated calmodulin, which promotes its transport to the contractile vacuole [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23441816  (Sriskanthadevan et al., 2013)].<br />Early adhesion can be blocked by 10 mM EDTA and is mediated by contact site B [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5002049  (Gerisch, 1968]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4993098  Beug, et al.1970)]. High levels of EDTA or other dicarboxylic acids block contact site B adhesion other than by chelating calcium since early developing cells will stick to each other without added calcium even in the presence of 1 mM EDTA [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3569662  (Knecht et al., 1987)]. Moreover, Ca(2+) does not induce major conformational changes in DdCAD-1 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17057715  (Lin et al., 2006)]. Mutant strains in which ''cadA'' is disrupted show reduced EDTA-sensitive adhesion but can, despite some milder defects, complete development and form fruiting bodies [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12135922  (Wong et al., 2002)]. <br />DdCAD-1 localizes to membrane ruffles at the anterior of the migrating cell during early development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8806827  (Sesaki and Siu, 1996]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11792801  Coates and Harwood, 2001)]. Furthermore, Sriskanthadevan and colleagues developed ''cadA'' knockout cells as chimeras with wild type on non-nutrient agar and found that the mutant cells sorted to be spores in the fruiting body, behaving like facultative cheaters. On soil plates the same chimeras showed the opposite effect but this was found to be due to the soil particles preventing effective adhesion of the ''cadA'' null mutant and as a result these cells did not mix well with wild type [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21561987  (Sriskanthadevan et al., 2011)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 26-SEP-2019 PF; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

DDB_G0271022	Robert Dodson	The AdcC protein contains a central core containing both the arrestin N-terminal and arrestin C-terminal domains, flanked by an N-terminal phospholipid binding (C2) domain and a C-terminal protein-protein interaction (SAM) domain [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19794886  (Aubry et al. 2009)]. Arrestin double mutants cells ''adcB/adcC'' ([/gene/DDB_G0274395 adcB]) display cAMP oscillations during aggregation that are twice as frequent as wild type cells. AdcC associates with ErkB ([/gene/DDB_G0283903 erkB]) and ''adcB/adcC'' mutant cells also have a shorter period of transient ERK2 activity and precociously reactivate ErkB in response to cAMP stimulation. In addition, activation of cAR1 ([/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0273533 carA-2]) promotes the transient membrane recruitment of AdcC and interaction with cAR1, indicating that arrestins function in cAR1-controlled periodic ERK2 activation and oscillatory cAMP signaling in the aggregation stage of D. discoideum development.[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25143405  (Cao et al. 2014)]. AdcC localization to the plasma membrane is regulated by calcium, and this response requires both the C2 and SAM domains. AdcC also responds to both cAMP and folate. AdcC binds phospholipids in a calcium-dependent manner and is also capable of forming homo-oligomers.

DDB_G0267384	Robert Dodson	CulB is a member of the cullin family of proteins that function as scaffolds that, along with F- box/WD40-repeat-containing proteins, mediate the ubiquitination of proteins to target them for degradation by the proteasome. ''culB'' was isolated in a screen of REMI mutants that form aberrant fruiting bodies ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12455979 Wang and Kuspa, 2002)]. When ''culB'' is knocked out in a wild type background, the cells develop into multi-tipped mounds that each give rise to a small fruiting body. Only about 17% of the wild-type number of viable spores are formed. When allowed to develop together with mostly wild type cells, ''culB'' mutant cells are distributed in the stalk, the basal disk, upper and lower cups, but rarely among the spores in the sorus. The prestalk marker ''ecmA'', ([/gene/DDB_G0277853 ecmA]) which is normally only expressed after 12 hours of development, is strongly expressed after 4 hours of development in ''culB'' mutant cells. It appears that CulB normally delays prestalk cell differentiation until the optimal proportion of prestalk and prespore cells can be established. When the rate of development is accelerated by inactivation of the regulatory subunit of PKA, ([/gene/DDB_G0279413 pkaR]) the effects of loss of CulB are amplified; almost no spores are formed in ''culB''/''pkaR'' double null cells and most mutant cells vacuolize and lay down cellulosic cell walls like stalk cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12455979 Wang and Kuspa, 2002)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 21-FEB-2019 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0281381	Robert Dodson	''Dictyostelium'' is the simplest organism known to employ STAT signaling. STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) proteins are characterized by a DNA binding domain, an SH2 domain, and a site of tyrosine phosphorylation. A STAT becomes activated when a ligand binds to its receptor, inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of the monomeric STAT molecule. Four STATs have been identified in ''Dictyostelium'', [/gene/DDB_G0281381 dstA], [/gene/DDB_G0268638 dstB], [/gene/DDB_G0293532 dstC] and [/gene/DDB_G0275167 dstD]. STATa was first identified biochemically, as the TTGA-binding factor that binds in vitro to the [/gene/DDB_G0277853 ecmA] activator and [/gene/DDB_G0269132 ecmB] repressor elements (Kawata ''et al.'' [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8670809 1996], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9200609 1997]), and genetically in a REMI screen for mutants that are blocked in fruiting-body formation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10393118 Mohanty et al. 1999]). During development, STATa is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to cAMP in a [/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1]-dependent manner. STATa is downregulated by [/gene/DDB_G0273097 ptpA1-1] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11254360 Early et al. 2001]). The protein kinase DrkA ([/gene/DDB_G0289791 drkA]) phosphorylates and activates STATa ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002205 Saga et al. 2019]). <br />''dstA''-null organisms do not culminate and form structures that lack stalk cells and a stalk tube, although the cells differentiate into stalk cells in culture ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10393118 Mohanty et al. 1999]).[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10821768  (Fukuzawa and Williams 2000)] demonstrated that STATa ([/gene/DDB_G0281381 dstA]), activates ''cudA'' expression in tip-organizer cells of the migrating slug.

DDB_G0287773	Robert Dodson	The glycine cleavage system complex consists of four proteins that function to catalyze the net reaction glycine + THFA &lt;=&gt; NH<sub>3</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> + 5,10-methylene THFA. The glycine cleavage complex contains a P-protein ([/gene/DDB_G0287255 gcvP]), a glycine dehydrogenase, and an aminomethyltransferase T-protein ([/gene/DDB_G0292326 gcvT]). Interestingly, the ''Dicytostelium'' proteome includes five putative methylamine carrier H-proteins ''gcvH1'', ([/gene/DDB_G0290845 gcvH2], [/gene/DDB_G0287791 gcvH3], [/gene/DDB_G0287795 gcvH4] and [/gene/DDB_G0287861 gcvH5]) whereas other species contain only one H-protein. The final component of the glycine cleavage system is ([/gene/DDB_G0291648 lpd]) a dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase that is a member of several other dehydrogenase complexes, including the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1993704 Kume et al. 1991]). <br />A genetic screen of an insertional mutant library identified ''gcvH1'' as having reduced sensitivity to cannabidiol (CBD). The protein GCVH1 localizes to the mitochondrion. A ''gcvH1'' null mutant showed elevated glycine levels and increased tetrahydrofolate levels, supporting a role for ''gcvH1'' in the glycine cleavage system. Treatment of wild-type cells with CBD significantly lowered methionine levels, but this effect was lost in ''gcvH1'' null cells, suggesting a mechanism of CBD action through inhibition of methionine production and regulation of one carbon metabolism. A form of cannabidiol (CBD) has demonstrated seizure control activity in patients with Dravet syndrome. Induction of seizure-like activity also elevates rat neuronal methionine levels, and acute CBD treatment attenuates this effect. Thus these combined results from ''Dictyostelium'' and mammalian cells suggest a novel mechanism for CBD in regulating methionine levels, and identify altered one-carbon metabolism in Dravet syndrome and seizure activity.

DDB_G0276369	Robert Dodson	The motor domain and microtubule binding sites in the kinesin encoded by ''kif5'' are at the N-terminus as is seen in other members of the kinesin KHC subfamily that includes products of the Dictyostelium genes kif3 ([/gene/DDB_G0280967 kif3]) and kif7 ([/gene/DDB_G0281555 kif7]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12015984  (Klopfenstein et al. 2002)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14641909  (Kollmar and Glockner 2003)]. These conventional kinesins are involved in transport of diverse organelles to the plus ends of microtubules. In addition, Kif5 connects the microtubule network to the actin network since the motor domain binds directly to microtubules in an ATP-dependent manner and the C-terminal domain interacts with actin filaments [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14623897  (Iwai et al. 2004)]. Moreover, Kif5 is found associated with F-actin in protrusions of the cell surface. Since ''kif5'' null cells grow well and have a normal distribution of F-actin, it appears that other kinesins can provide the essential functions if necessary. Cells overexpressing ''kif5'' have multiple crowns enriched with actin filaments along their periphery. When grown in suspension, these cells have defects in cytokinesis that may result from excess F-actin at the cleavage furrrow [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14623897  (Iwai et al. 2004)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 08-JUN-2017 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

DDB_G0284331	Robert Dodson	The major intracellular cAMP phosphodiesterase is encoded by ''regA'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8986798 Shaulsky et al. 1996)]. RegA associates with PkaR ([/gene/DDB_G0279413 pkaR]) and catalyzes the hydrolysis of bound cAMP ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9435289 Shaulsky et al. 1998)]. The catalytic subunit of PKA ([/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC]) then displaces RegA and reforms the inactive PKA complex ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20923972 Moorthy et al. 2011)]. RegA carries a response regulator domain at the N-terminus that accepts phosphate from the H2 relay protein RdeA ([/gene/DDB_G0282923 rdeA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9582274 Chang et al. 1998], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10488068  Thomason et al. 1999)]. Phosphorylation of the response regulator domain of RegA allosterically activates the catalytic domain found near the carboxy-terminus ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22326871 Moorthy et al. 2012)]. Multiple histidine kinases relay phosphate to RdeA and can thereby modulate cAMP levels by controlling the phosphodiesterase activity. DhkA ([/gene/DDB_G0280961 dhkA]) is a receptor histidine kinase that acts in a two-component system with RegA ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8670894 Wang et al. 1996], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10373524 Wang et al. 1999)]. When DhkA binds its peptide ligand, SDF-2, it acts as a phosphatase to remove phosphate from RdeA which can then dephosphorylate RegA and reduce its activity ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9191038 Loomis et al. 1997], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9582277 Thomason et al. 1998)]. RegA is part of the circuit that generates 6 minute oscillations in cAMP during aggregation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9843585 Laub et al. 1998], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15131307 Maeda et al. 2004)]. When external cAMP binds to the CAR1 ([/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0273533 carA-2]) receptor, ERK2 ([/gene/DDB_G0283903 erkB]) is activated and then associates with and inhibits RegA ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31730032 Adhikari et al. 2019)]. cAMP can then rapidly build up until it activates the cAMP dependent protein kinase PKA which blocks ERK2 inhibition of RegA; the resulting RegA activity drives the concentration of cAMP back down. Cells in which ''regA'' is disrupted develop precociously much like cells in which ''pkaR'' is disrupted ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9435289 Shaulsky et al. 1998)]. These mutant cells are also impaired in chemotaxis as the result of being unable to suppress lateral pseudopods in the front of natural cAMP waves ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10930471 Wessels et al. 2000)]. The signaling molecule differentiation-inducing factor 2 (DIF-2) modulates chemotaxis to cAMP via the DhkC ([/gene/DDB_G0274191 dhkC])-RegA-RdeA signaling pathway.

DDB_G0268620	Robert Dodson	''pkbA'' encodes the homolog of the protein kinase B made by the oncogene Akt ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10205164 Meili et al. 1999)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10192918 Tanaka et al. 1999)]. PKB is essential for aggregation at low cell densities but is dispensible in confluent monolayers. This protein kinase is transiently activated in response to cAMP binding to the G protein coupled receptor, Car1 ([/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1], [/gene/DDB_G0273533 carA-2]). Stimulation of PI3 kinase by Galpha2 ([/gene/DDB_G0276267 gpaB]) acting through RasG ([/gene/DDB_G0293434 rasG]), leads to rapid accumulation of phosphoinositids at the leading edge of chemotactically migrating cells. PKB can bind to PIP2 and PIP3 through its N-terminal PH-domain and become localized to the membrane at the front of migrating cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10192918 Tanaka et al. 1999)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11553719 Rupper et al. 2001)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15534002 Sasaki et al. 2004)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15352238 Secko et al. 2004)]. cAMP induced phosphorylation of PKB is blocked by loss of RasC ([/gene/DDB_G0281385 rasC]), or inhibition of PI3Ks ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11500376 Lim et al. 2001)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20660630 Cai et al. 2010)]. The protein kinase TORC2 ([/gene/DDB_G0281569 tor]) is responsible for phosphorylation of a hydrophobic motif in the C-terminal region of PKB ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16079174 Lee et al. 2005)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18635356 Kamimura et al. 2008)]. PKB can then be activated by the protein kinase PDK1 ([/gene/DDB_G0281471 pdkA]) which phosphorylates the activation loop ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20200230 Kimmel et al. 2010)]. The adaptor protein, Daydreamer ([/gene/DDB_G0287875 dydA]), is responsible for deactivating PKB ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23135995 Kolsch et al. 2013)]. The defects in chemotaxis that result from constitutive high levels of PIP3 in cells lacking PTEN ([/gene/DDB_G0286557 pten]) can be suppressed by knocking out ''pkbA'', suggesting that the localization of PKB to the front of cells is essential for polarization ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21169559 Tang et al. 2010)]. PKB localizes persistantly at the front when cell-cell contacts are formed ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10205164 Meili et al. 1999)]. Secreted Counting Factor (CF) increases cell motility by potentiating the cAMP-stimulated translocation and activation of PKB ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15470246 Gao et al. 2004)]. <br />PKB phosphorylates serines and threonines in many different proteins including PakA, ([/gene/DDB_G0269166 pakA]), PikI, ([/gene/DDB_G0267588 pikI]), talinB, ([/gene/DDB_G0287505 talB]), GefN, ([/gene/DDB_G0275703 gefN]), GacG ([/gene/DDB_G0283955 gacG]) and triggers polymerization of dendritic actin at the leading edge ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11389841 Chung et al. 2001)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18635356 Kamimura et al. 2008)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18452713 Janetopoulos and Firtel, 2008)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20192768 Swaney et al. 2010)]. Phosphorylation of PikI activates its phosphoinositol 5-kinase activity leading to the production of PI(4,5)P2 which is essential for chemotaxis and activation of PKB ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24485835 Fets et al. 2014)]. PKB also phosphorylates a Ras signaling complex that controls activation of RasC and its downstream target TORC2 in a negative feedback loop ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20493808 Charest et al. 2010)]. Mutants lacking PKB show chemotactic defects including failure to suppress lateral pseudopods ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10205164 Meili et al. 1999)]. Fluid uptake by macropinocytosis is reduced about 3 fold and phagosomes remain more acidic in ''pkbA''- null cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11553719 Rupper et al. 2001)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11256995 Rupper et al. 2001)]. Fluid uptake is almost abolished in ''pkbA''/''pkgB'' ([/gene/DDB_G0290157 pkgB]) double mutants due to the signifcantly reduced size of macropinosomes in these mutant cells. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30617109 Williams et al. 2019)].The activity of PKB can be inhibited by AKT inhibitors IV and VIII ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16672332  (Anjard and Loomis, 2006)]. DIF-1 leads to rapid dephosphorylation of PKB and its substrates ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25518940 Sugden et al. 2014)].

Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rab GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Rab GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. Rab5A is an ortholog of human Rab5A. Rab subfamily small GTPases in many organisms are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking. <br />Proteomic analysis revealed that Rab5A is localized to the Legionella-containing vacuole [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24373249  (Hoffmann et al. 2013)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28183814  (Schmolders et al. 2017)] and is associated with ''M. marinum''-containing compartments ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25779329 Barisch, et al. 2015]). Rab5A localizes to the plasma membrane, macropinosomes, and phagosomes. The Rab GAP TbcrA ([/gene/DDB_G0282575 tbcrA]) binds to and has GAP activity towards Rab5A. The PH-domain containing protein PripA ([/gene/DDB_G0275795 pripA]) binds to and forms a protein complex with TbcrA which facilitates Rab5A inactivation and promotes Rab5-to-Rab7 ([/gene/DDB_G0269236 rab7A]) conversion and macropinosome and phagosome maturation (Tu, et al 2022, PMID:35379834).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 15-APR-2022 RD

DDB_G0286187	Robert Dodson	Profilins are small, well-conserved, actin-binding proteins that also bind other proteins as well as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Dictyostelium has three genes encoding profilin, ([/gene/DDB_G0287125 proA]), ''proB'' and ([/gene/DDB_G0271142 proC]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1725525  (Haugwitz et al. 1991)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17467078  (Arasada et al. 2007)]. ''proB'' is expressed in vegetative cells as well as during early development giving a peak of mRNA abundance at T=11 hrs [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. ''In vitro'', profilin II raises the critical concentration of G-actin necessary for F-actin formation and delays the onset of elongation of F-actin more than profilin I, perhaps as the consequence of having a higher affinity to G-actin [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1725525  (Haugwitz et al. 1991)]. When profilin II binds G-actin it stimulates the exchange of ADP by ATP in G-actin which allows it to polymerize. Single mutants in which ''proB'' is inactivated show no significant defects, but double mutants with null mutations in both ''proA'' and ''proB'' have growth and developmental defects. The cells do not grow in suspension and become multinucleated when grown on solid supports. Aggregation proceeds well but mounds do not culminate and spores are not formed by the double mutants. F-actin is 60% more abundant in the double mutants than in wild type cells. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7954798  (Haugwitz et al. 1994)]. In addition, profilin double mutants are defective in macropinocytosis, fluid phase efflux, and secretion of lysosomal enzymes, but are more efficient in phagocytosis than wt cells. Disruption of the ''lmpA'' ([/gene/DDB_G0267406 lmpA]) gene in the profilin double null background suppressed the endocytic defects and phagocytic increases, suggesting that LmpA may act as a negative regulator of profilin [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10848626  (Temesvari et al. 2000)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11683394  (Seastone et al. 2001)].

DDB_G0278809	Robert Dodson	The centrosomal protein CP148 is encoded by ''cepG'' [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19466752  (Schulz et al. 2009)]. During metaphase CP148 is in the cytoplasm but during telophase it re-enters the expanding centrosomal corona where it remains until prophase when it returns to the cytopasm as the corona dissociates. CP148 is found in an intermediate position between outer coronal proteins and the central core centrosomal proteins. Cells with reduced levels of CP148 as the result of RNAi inhibition of ''cepG'' have cytosolic centrosomes lacking a corona and their interphase microtubules are disorganized. However, formation of the mitotic spindle and astral microtubules are unaffected in the ''cepG'' knock-down strain [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22223109  (Kuhnert et al. 2012)]. CP148 interacts with CP161 ([/gene/DDB_G0282851 cepL]) and protein localization studies in ''cepL'' and ''cepG'' depletion strains reveal that both are scaffolding proteins cooperating in the organization of the centrosomal corona [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29690637  (Pitzen et al., 2018)].

DDB_G0273805	Robert Dodson	''ndkC'' encodes the cytosolic form of nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase (EC 2.7.4.6). The related [/gene/DDB_G0279911 ndkM] gene encodes a mitochondrial NDP kinase ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8244981 Troll et al. 1993]). This enzyme is responsible for the phosphorylation of nucleoside or deoxynucleoside diphosphates into the corresponding triphosphates at the expense of ATP ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8931563 Deville-Bonne et al. 1996]). NDP kinase is transiently phosphorylated on an active site histidine as part of the catalytic process (see [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9786875 Schneider et al. 1998 and references therein]).<br />This enzyme plays a crucial role in equilibrating the cellular nucleotide pools (see [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9786875 Schneider et al. 1998 and references therein]). Besides this role in intermediate nucleotide metabolism, NDP kinase has been implicated in a large number of cellular functions. Part of the cellular NDP kinase is associated with the plasma membrane and stimulated by cell surface cAMP receptors. The GTP produced by the action of NDP kinase is capable of activating G-proteins as monitored by altered G-protein-receptor interaction and the activation of the effector enzyme phospholipase C ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8389692 Bominaar et al. 1993]). Nucleoside diphosphate kinase is also associated with the cytoskeleton where it channels ATP to the myosin molecule ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8816286 Aguado-Velasco et al. 1996]). Yet another role for NDP kinase is to feed GTP into the translation machinery, as inferred by its association with active ribosomes ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7733916 Sonnemann and Mutzel 1995]). Knock down of NDP kinase expression suppressed the phenotypic defects that are caused by AMPK ([/gene/DDB_G0277905 snfA]), hyperactivity resulting either from overexpression of AMP alpha T or from mitochondrial dysfunction.

The protein is a hexamer with D3 symmetry. The X-ray structure of wild type and several mutants nucleoside diphosphate kinase bound to substrates, co-factors and inhibitors has also been determined (see [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12171931 Gallois-Montbrun et al. 2002], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11277918 Schneider et al. 2001], and references therein).<br />Nucleoside analogs are currently used in antiretrovirus therapies. The best known example is AZT, one of the first drugs to be used for the treatment of AIDS.

DDB_G0273069	Robert Dodson	''ndkC'' encodes the cytosolic form of nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase (EC 2.7.4.6). The related [/gene/DDB_G0279911 ndkM] gene encodes a mitochondrial NDP kinase ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8244981 Troll et al. 1993]). This enzyme is responsible for the phosphorylation of nucleoside or deoxynucleoside diphosphates into the corresponding triphosphates at the expense of ATP ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8931563 Deville-Bonne et al. 1996]). NDP kinase is transiently phosphorylated on an active site histidine as part of the catalytic process (see [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9786875 Schneider et al. 1998 and references therein]).<br />This enzyme plays a crucial role in equilibrating the cellular nucleotide pools (see [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9786875 Schneider et al. 1998 and references therein]). Besides this role in intermediate nucleotide metabolism, NDP kinase has been implicated in a large number of cellular functions. Part of the cellular NDP kinase is associated with the plasma membrane and stimulated by cell surface cAMP receptors. The GTP produced by the action of NDP kinase is capable of activating G-proteins as monitored by altered G-protein-receptor interaction and the activation of the effector enzyme phospholipase C ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8389692 Bominaar et al. 1993]).

DDB_G0284651	Robert Dodson	The enzyme encoded by [/gene/DDB_G0284651 gcsA] is a gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCS) that catalyzes the first step in glutathione biosynthesis .[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15993406 Kim et al. (2005)] created a gcsA null strain that is inviable in the absence of glutathione (GSH). Mutant cells cultured with GSH predominantly arrest at the mound stage, while those that go on to produce defective fruiting bodies contain sori with inviable spores. This phenotype is cell autonomous as ''gcsA'' null cells sort to stalk regions in cell mixing experiments with wild-type cells. Further supporting a role for the GCS protein in sporulation is the absence of prespore and spore markers [/gene/DDB_G0277141 cotC], [/gene/DDB_G0267412 pspA], and [/gene/DDB_G0289075 spiA] in ''gscA'' null cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15993406 Kim et al. 2005]).<br />[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24373846 Kim et al. (2013)] showed that aggregation was inhibitied in gcsA disrupted cells, and that this developmental defect was rescued by exogenous GSH. In addition, there was no detectable expression of genes required for early development: [/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1],[/gene/DDB_G0281545 acaA], and [/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC]. However, constitutive expression of [/gene/DDB_G0283605 yakA] in gcsA- cells rescued the defects in developmental initiation and the expression of early developmental genes, suggesting that glutathione initiates ''Dictyostelium'' development through the regulation of YakA.

DDB_G0283909	Robert Dodson	Spc97 ([/gene/DDB_G0285849 spc97]) and Spc98 form a complex with gamma-tubulin ([/gene/DDB_G0271738 tubC]) that initiates microtubule polymerization in the spindle pole body of yeast. The ''Dictyostelium'' homologs are encoded by ''spc97'' and ''spc98'', respectively. Throughout the cell cycle they are found in the centrosome which functions as the main microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12018385  (Daunderer and Graf, 2002)]. Under high salt conditions Spc98 co-immunoprecipitates with gamma-tubulin but Spc97 fails to co-immunoprecipitate. In other organisms all 3 proteins are strongly held in a complex. In contrast to mammalian cells, there is no dramatic increase in microtubule nucleation during mitosis of ''Dictyostelium''. At prometaphase the gamma-tubulin/Spc98 complex rapidly redistributes from the centrosomal corona to the inner surfaces of the two outer layers of the centrosome allowing the microtubule spindle to drive the two spindle poles apart [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9880333  (Ueda et al. 1999)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12018385  (Daunderer and Graf, 2002)]. Functional microtubule-nucleating units may be formed when Spc97 associates with the gamma-tubulin/Spc98 complex. About 100 different proteins contribute to centrosomal functions including the products of ''tubC'', ([/gene/DDB_G0285849 spc97]), ''spc98'', ([/gene/DDB_G0288427 cenA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0288375 lis1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0270814 nek2]), ([/gene/DDB_G0283607 eb1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0268616 cepJ]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0278809 cepG]).

DDB_G0287293	Robert Dodson	A family of nearly identical small proteins, GerA, GerB, and GerC, ([/gene/DDB_G0287687 gerB]), ([/gene/DDB_G0287583 gerC]) are coordinately synthesized during late culmination and again following the initiation of germination of spores [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2926809  (Giorda et al. 1989)]. Each of the proteins is 127 amino acids long and has a cannonical signal sequence at the N-terminus that could direct co-translational transport across membranes. No conserved domains are present that could give an indication of possible functions. The nucleotide sequences of the respective genes, ''gerA'', ''gerB'', and ''gerC'', are all very similar and are free of introns. These genes may result from recent duplications. Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 10-OCT-2018 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0291856	Robert Dodson	''gerD'' encodes a 163 kDa protein that carries 13 tandem copies of the unusual tetrapeptide repeat (TETP) found in both CelA ([/gene/DDB_G0271134 celA]) and CelB ([/gene/DDB_G0269112 celB]) but does not otherwise show significant sequence similarity with other Dictyostelium proteins [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1976383  (Giorda et al. 1990)]. Like ''celA'' and ''celB'', ''gerD'' is transiently expressed 2 hrs. after the initiation of germination. The protein has a signal sequence at the N-terminus that could direct co-translational transport across membranes and a C-terminal putative carbohydrate binding domain. Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 18-OCT-2018 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0282851	Robert Dodson	CEP161, encoded by the ''cepL'' gene, is a novel component of the centrosome which has been identified as a binding partner of the pericentriolar component CP250 (gene [/gene/DDB_G0293544 cepK]). Over-expression of truncated and full length CEP161 proteins revealed defects in growth, development, adhesion and centrosomal organization. The hippo related severin kinase ([/gene/DDB_G0289327 sevA]) was also found to bind CEP161 and both proteins co-localize at the centrosome. In in vitro kinase assays the N-terminal domain of CEP161 (residues 1-763) inhibited the kinase activity [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25607232  (Sukumaran et al., 2015)].<br />RNAi depletion of ''cepL'' results in complete disorganization of centrosomes and microtubules, while CepL overexpressing strains displayed supernumerary cytosolic microtubule organizing centers. In addition, CepL was shown to interact with several centrosomal proteins: CP75 ([/gene/DDB_G0283111 cepD]), CP91 ([/gene/DDB_G0275495 cepE]), CP148 ([/gene/DDB_G0278809 cepG]), Cep192 ([/gene/DDB_G0285313 cepH]) and gamma-tubulin ([/gene/DDB_G0271738 tubC]). Protein localization studies in ''cepL'' and ''cepG'' depletion strains reveal that both are scaffolding proteins cooperating in the organization of the centrosomal corona [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29690637  (Pitzen et al., 2018)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 02-FEB-2019 RD
DDB_G0287125	Robert Dodson	Profilins are small, well-conserved, actin-binding proteins that also bind other proteins as well as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Dictyostelium has three genes encoding profilin, ''proA'', ([/gene/DDB_G0286187 proB]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0271142 proC]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1725525  (Haugwitz et al. 1991)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17467078  (Arasada et al. 2007)]. ''proA'' is expressed during early development giving a peak of mRNA abundance at T=11 hrs [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. ''In vitro'', profilin I raises the critical concentration of G-actin necessary for F-actin formation and delays the onset of elongation of F-actin [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1725525  (Haugwitz et al. 1991)]. When profilin I binds G-actin it stimulates the exchange of ADP by ATP in G-actin which allows it to polymerize. Single mutants in which ''proA'' is inactivated show no significant defects, but double mutants with null mutations in both ''proA'' and ''proB'' have growth and developmental defects. The cells do not grow in suspension and become multinucleated when grown on solid supports. Aggregation proceeds well but mounds do not culminate and spores are not formed by the double mutants. F-actin is 60% more abundant in the double mutants than in wild type cells [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7954798  (Haugwitz et al. 1994)]. In addition, profilin double mutants are defective in macropinocytosis, fluid phase efflux, and secretion of lysosomal enzymes, but are more efficient in phagocytosis than wt cells. Disruption of the ''lmpA'' ([/gene/DDB_G0267406 lmpA]) gene in the profilin double null background suppressed the endocytic defects and phagocytic increases, suggesting that LmpA may act as a negative regulator of profilin [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10848626  (Temesvari et al. 2000)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11683394  (Seastone et al. 2001)].

DDB_G0270736	Robert Dodson	''rasV'' encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Ras family of small GTPases. G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs, rasGEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs, rasGAPs) inactivate Ras GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. An analysis of ''Dictyostelium'' ras family genes reveals that ''rasU'' ([/gene/DDB_G0270138 rasU]), ''rasV'', ''rasW'' ([/gene/DDB_G0270122 rasW]), ''rasX'' ([/gene/DDB_G0270124 rasX]), ''rasY'' ([/gene/DDB_G0270126 rasY]) and ''rasZ'' ([/gene/DDB_G0270140 rasZ]) form a separate phylogenetic clade ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29614268 Park et al. 2018]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 18-MAR-2020 RD

DDB_G0285101	Robert Dodson	The motor domain in the kinesin encoded by ''kif4'' is at the N-terminus and belongs to the CENP-E family of domains of kinetochore associated proteins that align chromosomes during mitosis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14641909  (Kollmar and Glockner 2003)]. A nuclear localization signal is found following the motor domain. Based on the sequences of the motor domains six of the 13 kinesins ([/gene/DDB_G0267396 kif2]), ''kif4'', ([/gene/DDB_G0267404 kif6]), ([/gene/DDB_G0291039 kif11]), ([/gene/DDB_G0268258 kif12]), and ([/gene/DDB_G0288361 kif13]) are members of mitotic motor families. ''kif4'' null cells grow considerably more slowly than wild type cells but develop normally [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18430243  (Nag et al. 2008)]. When ''kif4'' null cells were transformed with a plasmid expressing the 380-kDa truncated version of dynein heavy chain, ([/gene/DDB_G0276355 dhcA]), transformants were able to grow on a solid surface but did not grow in suspension and displayed aberrant spindle formation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18430243  (Nag et al. 2008)]. It appears that Kif4 and dynein cooperate in mitotic spindle assembly. Like each of the other mitotic kinesins, ''kif4'' mRNA levels are low in growing cells and increase to relatively high levels between 12 and 18 hrs of development before returning to very low levels [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9693369  (de Hostos et al. 1998)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 02-JUN-2017 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

DDB_G0288569	Robert Dodson	Strumpellin is a member a five protein assembly, the WASH complex, whose core members are WASH ([/gene/DDB_G0292878 wshA]), SWIP ([/gene/DDB_G0283355 swip]), FAM21 ([/gene/DDB_G0276221 fam21]), ([/gene/DDB_G0267948 ccdc53]) and Strumpellin. The WASH complex is highly conserved [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993425  (Insall et al. 2013)] and plays an essential role in the endosomal system and is responsible for recycling of the V-ATPase from post-lysosomes prior to exocytosis. Mutations in either one of the five members results in a complete block in exocytosis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21606208  (Carnell et al. 2011)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23369714  (Park et al. 2013)]. ''washc5'' null cells display defects in cell growth, phagocytosis, exocytosis, and lysosome function which are rescued by expression of Strumpellin. An N471D point mutation in the human ortholog of Strumpelin (WASHC5) is associated with the neurodegenerative disorder Heriditary Spastic paraplegia 8. A mutant with a point mutation in the corresponding residue in Dictyostelium ''washc5'' has defects in lysosome function and exocytosis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30061306  (Song et al. 2018)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 05-SEP-2018 RD
DDB_G0277755	Robert Dodson	''dclre1'' encodes the homolog of the vertebrate nuclease Artemis that is involved in repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16112620  (Block and Lees-Miller, 2005)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16582628  (Hsu et al. 2006)]. Defects in human Artemis result in severe combined immunodeficiency (bubble boy disease) due to a defect in the recombinational events that generate immunoglobin genes. Disruption of ''dclre1'' in ''Dictyostelium'' results in cells with defective DNA integration into the chromosomes following transformation of restriction fragments together with the restriction enzyme that cut them out [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21536833  (Hsu et al. 2011)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 16-JAN-2019 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0267976	Robert Dodson	''Dictyostelium'' contains orthologs of the core components of the presenilin/gamma-secretase complex: presenilin A ([/gene/DDB_G0291352 psenA]), presenilin B ([/gene/DDB_G0292310 psenB]), Aph-1 ([/gene/DDB_G0267976 aph1]) and nicastrin ([/gene/DDB_G0287801 ncstn]) which are capable of amyloidogenic processing of ectopically expressed human amyloid precursor protein (APP) to generate amyloid-beta peptides. Gamma-secretase activity is required for phagocytosis in Dictyostelium, and gamma-secretase mutants have primary defects in pre-spore/spore differentiation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20699477  (McMains et al. 2010)]. ''Dictyostelium'' orthologs of the gamma-secretase complex PsenA, PsenB, Aph-1, and Nicastrin are necessary for macropinocytosis, phagocytosis, and autophagy, indicating roles in a general defect in lysosomal trafficking and degradation. In addition, loss of psenA/psenB and Aph-1 leads to an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, suggesting impaired protein degradation in these mutants. All of the endocytic defects in PSEN ortholog mutants can be fully restored by proteolytically inactive ''Dictyostelium'' PsenB and human PSEN1, demonstrating an evolutionarily conserved non-proteolytic role for presenilin in lysosomal trafficking and autophagy.

DDB_G0289177	Robert Dodson	Besides ''mhcA'' ([/gene/DDB_G0286355 mhcA]) that encodes the classical myosin heavy chain, ''Dictyostelium'' carries genes for 12 unconventional myosins. The first 5 unconventional myosins: ([/gene/DDB_G0280039 myoA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0289117 myoB]), ([/gene/DDB_G0276617 myoC]), ([/gene/DDB_G0275447 myoD]), ([/gene/DDB_G0288679 myoE]), were isolated from whole genome plasmid clones by low stringency probing with portions of the head region of ''mhcA''. The next 6 unconventional myosins: ([/gene/DDB_G0289177 myoF]), ([/gene/DDB_G0276363 myoG]), ([/gene/DDB_G0289447 myoH]), ([/gene/DDB_G0274455 myoI]), ([/gene/DDB_G0272112 myoJ]), ([/gene/DDB_G0274575 myoK]) were recognized in large YAC clones that represent the whole genome [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7937787  (Titus et al. 1994) ]. The amino acid sequences of MyoD, MyoE, and MyoF are more similar to each other than to other myosins. ''myoF'' encodes myosin 1F that functions together with MyoD and MyoE in growth and development. While mutants lacking MyoF have no obvious growth defects, double mutants lacking both MyoE and MyoF grow more slowly, aggregate more slowly and make misshapen fruiting bodies. Triple mutants cells lacking ''myoD'', ''myoE'' and ''myoF'' are defective in chemotaxis to cAMP, chemoattractant-stimulated actin polymerization and phagocytosis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7787058  (Titus et al. 1995)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22296834  (Chen et al. 2012)]. Both MyoE and MyoF localize to macropinocytic cups and actin waves [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26801966  (Brzeska et al. 2016)]. The tail domain of MyoF, like that of MyoD and MyoE, binds PIP3 resulting in its accumulation at the front of migrating cells where the PI3kinases are active and PTEN is excluded [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22296834  (Chen et al. 2012)]. Cells lacking MyoF also have difficulty maintaining an elongated polarized shape during chemotaxis in a cAMP gradient [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12953059  (Falk et al. 2003)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 28-AUG-2019 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0274191	Robert Dodson	The histidine kinase ''dhkC'' regulates the choice between migrating slugs and culmination. ''dhkC'' encodes a histidine kinase similar to DhkA ([/gene/DDB_G0280961 dhkA]) and DhkB ([/gene/DDB_G0277845 dhkB]) but lacking transmembrane domains. High levels of ammonia result in prolonged slug migration in wild type strains but not in ''dhkC'' null mutants. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9808785 Singleton et al. 1998)]. Cells lacking ''dhkC'' develop to the finger stage more rapidly than wild type cells and skip the slug stage to culminate directly, a phenotype shared by mutant strains in which PKA ([/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC]), ([/gene/DDB_G0279413 pkaR]) is abnormally active for a variety of genetic reasons. Mutant strains expressing the central kinase domain of DhkC without the flanking control regions resulted in constitutive gain-of-function that blocked culmination. This slugger phenotype was suppressed in these cells by mutations in the cAMP phosphodiesterase gene, RegA ([/gene/DDB_G0284331 regA]); [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9808785  Singleton et al. 1998)]. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the ammonium transporter genes, amtA ([/gene/DDB_G0277503 amtA]) and amtC ([/gene/DDB_G0267424 amtC]) regulate the dhkC phosphorelay ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16835443 Singleton et al. 2006)] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16188250 Kirsten et al. 2005)]. In response to ammonia, it appears that DhkC activates RegA by phosphorelay to its response regulatory region. ''regA'' is expressed in both prespore and prestalk cells in the slug, while ''dhkC'' expression is prestalk specific at this stage ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420 Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. The histidine kinase keeps the phosphodiesterase activity high in prestalk cells until the levels of ammonia drop. Thereafter, cAMP and PKA activity can increase and trigger stalk formation. The signaling molecule differentiation-inducing factor 2 (DIF-2) modulates chemotaxis to cAMP via the DhkC-RegA-RdeA ([/gene/DDB_G0282923 rdeA]) signaling pathway ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26919666 Kuwayama and Kubohara 2016)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 24-JAN-2017 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0280967	Robert Dodson	The motor domain and microtubule binding sites in the kinesin encoded by ''kif3'' are at the N-terminus as is seen in other members of the kinesin KHC subfamily that includes products of the Dictyostelium genes kif5 ([/gene/DDB_G0276369 kif5]) and kif7 ([/gene/DDB_G0281555 kif7]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12952062  (Klopfenstein et al. 2002)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14641909  (Kollmar and Glockner 2003)]. These conventional kinesins are involved in transport of diverse organelles to the plus ends of microtubules. Kif3 is a dimer that acts as a processive motor along microtubules and is found in the cytoplasm, and is enriched in vesicular structures that in part stain positive for the Golgi. It may transport cargo from the Golgi through the endosomal pathway. Kif3 is transcribed in both growing and developing cells and may be essential for survival since no knockout mutants could be isolated [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18160177  (Rohlk et al. 2008)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 01-JUN-2017 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

DDB_G0279413	Robert Dodson	''pkaR'' encodes the regulatory subunit of the cAMP dependent protein kinase PKA ([/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC], [/gene/DDB_G0279413 pkaR]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3467359 Mutzel et al. 1987], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1312226 Simon et al. 1992)]. cAMP functions as a second messenger within cells by activating PKA when it binds to the regulatory subunit PkaR. The regulatory subunit can reassociate with the catalytic subunit and inhibit it when the phosphodiesterase RegA ([/gene/DDB_G0284331 regA]) hydrolyses cAMP bound to PkaR ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9435289 Shaulsky et al. 1998], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20923972 Moorthy et al. 2011)]. PKA plays multiple roles throughout development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1728597 Harwood et al. 1992], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9126295 Mann et al. 1997], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9729606 Loomis et al. 1998], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25872182 Loomis et al. 2015)]. Strains with constitutive PKA activity as the result of null mutations in ''pkaR'' develop precociously ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1312226 Simon et al. 1992], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7937993 Mann et al. 1994], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7713325 Hopper et al. 1995)]. These mutant cells are also impaired in chemotaxis as the result of being unable to suppress lateral pseudopods in the front of natural cAMP waves ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12582123 Zhang et al. 2003)]. PKA ([/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC], [/gene/DDB_G0279413 pkaR]) also mediates the response of several xenobiotic compounds, including valproic acid, a treatment for bipolar disorder, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16759735  (Boeckeler et al. 2006)] and curcumin [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29135990  (Swatson et al. 2017)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 27-SEP-2018 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

The motor domain that binds microtubules is in the central region and nuclear anchorage is mediated by a transmembrane domain at the carboxyl terminus. The motor domain does not group with specific metazoan kinesins [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14641909  (Kollmar and Glockner 2003)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23213391  (Leo et al. 2012)]. Like [/gene/DDB_G0267404 kif6], the other kinesin with a central motor domain, Kif9 effects an endwise depolymerization of microtubules that may pull the centrosome up against the nucleus to ensure centrosome-nuclear parity in a multinuclear environment [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23161062  (Tikhonenko et al. 2012)].The rate of growth is significantly reduced in ''kif9'' null cells and the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) that contains the components of the centrosome often becomes disconnected from the nucleus during prophase [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19286984  (Tikhonenko et al. 2009)]. Detached centrosomes cannot produce the spindle-like microtubule arrays in the closed mitotic system of ''Dictyostelium'' that are essential for progress through mitosis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23213391  (Leo et al. 2012)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 30-JUN-2017 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis; annotation contributions PMID:23161062 Michael Koonce
DDB_G0278661	Petra Fey	TSET is the latest addition to trafficking proteins, which is ancient but frequently lost or reduced in evolution. The TSET complex is a heterohexamer and was named for the protein subunits in the complex, TSPOON (sigma-like), TPLATE (beta-like), TCUP (mu-like), TSAUCER (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, zeta-like), TTRAY1, and TTRAY2. This ancient adaptor complex (AP) was identified in organisms such as Dictyostelids and land plants, such as ''Arabidopsis''. Only the TCUP subunit has been retained in fungi and animals, in mammals it has evolved into the cargo adaptor muniscin. A TSPOON-GFP fusion (gene tstD) has been shown to physically bind the 5 other TSET subunits. The TTRAY subunits are beta-propeller / alpha-solenoid proteins and form the scaffold for the TSPOON, TPLATE, TCUP, TSAUCER, heterotetramer. TIRF microscopy showed a punctate temporary localization of the complex to the plasma membran [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24867644  (Hirst et al. 2014)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated,, 11-DEC-2018 PF
DDB_G0276267	Robert Dodson	G proteins are evolutionarily conserved heterotrimeric GTP binding proteins that can act as molecular switches. ''gpaB'' encodes one of the dozen G alpha subunits in ''Dictyostelium'', Galpha2, which associates with Gbeta and Ggamma subunits ([/gene/DDB_G0277143 gpbA], [/gene/DDB_G0274125 gpgA]) to form the G protein that binds to the cAMP receptor CAR1 ([/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1], [/gene/DDB_G0273533 carA-2]). [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2500658  (Pupillo et al. 1989)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2539262  (Kumagai et al. 1989)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1333842  (Pupillo et al. 1992)]. When cAMP is bound to the receptor, a conformational change in CAR1 stimulates exchange of GDP for GTP on Galpha2. The trimeric G protein dissociates into the active alpha subunit and the active beta/gamma dimer as long as cAMP is bound to the receptor [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11264536  (Janetopoulos et al. 2001)]. The subunits interact with downstream effectors such as RasGEFs and RasGAPs to trigger essential developmental events [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2546676  (Firtel et al. 1989)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8110455  (Devreotes, 1994)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18385017  (Kortholt and van Haastert, 2008)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23886948  (Kortholt et al. 2013)]. The inate GTPase activity of the alpha subunit hydrolyzes bound GTP to GDP which allows the subunits to reassociate and bind to the receptor; this terminates the signaling. ''gpaB'' is expressed during the aggregation stage coordinately with ''carA'' and ''acaA'' ([/gene/DDB_G0281545 acaA]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. <br />''gpaB'' plays an essential role in cAMP relay during aggregation and in prestalk differentiation during culmination [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8186466  (Carrel et al. 1994)]. Disruption of ''gpaB'' results in abolished aggregation and a loss of cAMP receptor-mediated functions, including activation of adenylate cyclase, guanylate cyclase ([/gene/DDB_G0275009 gcA]) and phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C ([/gene/DDB_G0292736 plc]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1355376  (Okaichi et al. 1992)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1670774  (Kumagai et al. 1991)] as well as abolished chemotaxis to cAMP and decreased activation of Ras GTPases [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23886948  (Kortholt et al. 2013)]. Galpha2 is myristoylated at its N-terminal and membrane localized, but inactive and active heterotrimeric G proteins shuttle between the plasma membrane and cytosol. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10404398  (Root et al. 1999)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19584094  (Elzie et al. 2009)]. A novel regulator of G proteins, G protein-interacting protein 1, ([/gene/DDB_G0271086 gip1]) binds GpaB, and ''gip1'' null cells have a decreased localization of Galpha2 to the plasma membrane.

DDB_G0275567	Robert Dodson	The ''Dictyostelium'' adenosylmethionine decarboxylase is very similar to the ''H. sapiens'' AMD1, which is is a proenzyme that undergoes autocatalytic cleavage generating alpha and beta subunits and forming a pyruvate prosthetic group. The bond between glutamic acid 67 and serine 68 were shown to be the site of cleavage . These residues, located at position 96 and 97 in the ''Dictyostelium'' protein, are highly conserved.

A REMI mutant was isolated in which ''erkA'' was disrupted by the inserted plasmid. Cells lacking ERK1 exhibit chemotaxis defects and make small aggregates that form tips only after a considerable delay. This phenotype is also seen in mutants lacking the MAP kinase kinase MEK1 ([/gene/DDB_G0269152 mekA]), suggesting that MEK1 and ERK1 are in the same regulatory cascade ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12062087 Sobko et al. 2002)]. In addition, ERK1 was shown to function in Galpha5 ([/gene/DDB_G0286185 gpaE]) subunit-mediated signal transduction. ERK1 was specifically required for Galpha5-mediated tip morphogenesis, suggesting this cascade might be responsible for production of signals necessary for tip formation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20079430 Nquyen et al. 2010)] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20019085 Raisley et al. 2010)].

DDB_G0277759	Petra Fey	The [/gene/DDB_G0277759 phyA] gene encodes a prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H1) that catalyzes hydroxylation of Skp1 ([/gene/DDB_G0269230 fpaA]/[/gene/DDB_G0273251 fpaB-1]) protein at Proline 143. HyPro143 is subsequently glycosylated by a series of reactions; this post-translational modification is necessary for nuclear enrichment of Skp1 in wild-type ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8287496 Sassi et al. 2001]). The ''Dictyostelium'' P4H1 protein is predicted to be related to the mammalian hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha-type prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H). This similarity is further evidenced by common properties, such as enzyme kinetics and cofactors, shared by both the Dd P4H1 and P4H ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/PUB4889 van der Wel et al. 2005]).<br />Glycosylation of Skp1 has been extensively studied in ''Dictyostelium''. The initial step in Skp1 glycosylation involves the hydroxylation of Pro143 by P4H1, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9660787 Teng-umnuay et al. 1998]). HyPro143 is then modified by the glycosyltransferase [/gene/DDB_G0275699 gnt1], which transfers a GlcNAc (N-acetylglucosamine) to the Skp1 protein ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10593934 Teng-umnuay et al. 1999]). The Skp1-GlcNAc is extended by a bifunctional diglycosyltransferase, [/gene/DDB_G0283761 pgtA], which processively adds galactose and fucose ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11423539 van der Wel et al. 2001], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12244067 van der Wel et al. 2002]). Subsequently two additional galactose residues are added by [/gene/DDB_G0283005 agtA] to yield the Skp1 pentasaccharide (GGFGGnOSkp1; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16495217 Ercan et al. 2006], reviewed in [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128470 West and Kim 2019]).<br />A ''phyA'' null mutant lacks Skp1 hydroxylation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/PUB4889 van der Wel et al. 2005]) and is unable to culminate under normal conditions; this defect is rescued at highly elevated oxygen levels (40-70%). ''in situ'' staining with an antibody raised against P4H1 shows that it is constitutively expressed in tipped mounds and slugs. Interestingly, the Skp1 hydroxylation and development defects of the ''phyA'' null mutant can be rescued by expressing ''phyA'' either in prespore or prestalk cells. Active P4H1 was required for complementation, as a mutant with no activity, R276A, failed to culminate ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17699611 West et al. 2007]). Further mutant analyses showed not only is Skp1 a substrate for P4H1, it is also a functional mediator of P4H1 activity in cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20969846 Wang et al. 2011]). Additional investigations showed that full SKP1 glycosylation is required for optimal oxygen sensing during development, for example [/gene/DDB_G0283005 agtA] knockout or overexpression mutants require elevated oxygen levels to culminate ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19687007 Wang et al. 2009], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22128189 Zhang et al. 2011], reviewed in [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25988702 West and Blader 2015]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 12-MAR-2020 PF
DDB_G0271086	Robert Dodson	''gip1'' encodes a 35 kDa protein containing a pleckstrin homology domain at the amino terminus. Gip1 was identified using a tandem affinity purification of Gbeta ([/gene/DDB_G0277143 gpbA]) and was shown to bind the heterotrimeric G-protein complex mainly through the beta/gamma subunit. ''gip1'' null mutants have severe defects in gradient sensing and display aberrant chemotaxis to cAMP, exhibiting normal chemotaxis at low cAMP concentrations, but defects at higher concentrations. Gip1 binds and sequesters G proteins in the cytosol. cAMP receptor ([/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1], [/gene/DDB_G0273533 carA-2]) activation induced G-protein translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane is dependent on Gip1 as shown by reduced membrane translocation of Galpha2 ([/gene/DDB_G0276267 gpaB]) in ''gip1'' null cells. These findings suggest that Gip1 regulates G protein translocation to the plasma membrane along chemical gradients at high chemo-attractant concentrations, offering an explanation for the ability of chemotactic cells to recognize chemical gradients over a wide range of concentrations.

DDB_G0289165	Petra Fey	Using comparative genomic hybridizations using DNA microarrays searching for genes that are present in any ''D. discoideum'' member of one mating type but absent or highly diverged in other members lead to the identification of the ''matA'' genes. Single, unrelated genes (''matA'', ''matS'') are sufficient to determine two of the mating types, whereas homologs of both of these genes ''matB''. ''matC'', respectively) are required in the composite type. A type I ''matA'' null mutant was transformed with the type II locus (''matB''. ''matC'' and ''matD'') effectively switching the mating type proving this is the locus for sex determination. MatD plays a possible role in gamete fusion [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21148389  (Bloomfield et al. 2010)].<br />Unlike haploid dictyostelid cells, zygotes feed cannibalistically on other amoebae of the same species, growing without cell division forming a syncytia and eventually a dormant walled structure called a macrocyst. This large cell is thought to go through meiosis before haploid progeny resumes the mitotic cell cycle. ''Dictyostelium discoideum'' has three mating types: matA for type I, matS for type III, and both matB and matC for type II. However, although matB is genetically compatible with matS, and matA with matC, in specifying sexually compatible pairs, matB and matC are incompatible.<br /> The ''mat'' genes encode proteins with helix-turn-helix folds flanked by largely disordered amino- and carboxyl-terminal tails, resembling homeodomain proteins. For matA and matB it has been shown that they bind DNA in the C-terminal helix, and expression of chimeras showed the C-terminal tail determines mating specificity. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28879231  (Hedgethorne et al. 2017)].<br /> Genome-wide analysis of progeny from three crosses revealed that recombination is very frequent, with at least one crossover per chromosome. Progeny from each macrocyst are identical, thus only one meiotic product survives. Tree-way crossing of a mating type I , a type II and an excess of matA null cells that cannot produce meiotic progeny showed that a third mating type contributes mitochondrial DNA, but not participating in nuclear DNA cross-overs. Thus fusions of more than two gametes to form transient syncytia lead to frequent triparental inheritance, with haploid meiotic progeny bearing recombined nuclear haplotypes from two parents and the mitochondrial genome from a third [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30670662  (Bloomfield et al. 2019)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 01-MAR-2019 PF
DDB_G0287801	Robert Dodson	''Dictyostelium'' contains orthologs of the core components of the presenilin/gamma-secretase complex: presenilin A ([/gene/DDB_G0291352 psenA]), presenilin B ([/gene/DDB_G0292310 psenB]), Aph-1 ([/gene/DDB_G0267976 aph1]) and nicastrin ([/gene/DDB_G0287801 ncstn]) which are capable of amyloidogenic processing of ectopically expressed human amyloid precursor protein (APP) to generate amyloid-beta peptides. Gamma-secretase activity is required for phagocytosis in Dictyostelium, and gamma-secretase mutants have primary defects in pre-spore/spore differentiation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20699477  (McMains et al. 2010)]. ''Dictyostelium'' orthologs of the gamma-secretase complex PsenA, PsenB, Aph-1, and Nicastrin are necessary for macropinocytosis, phagocytosis, and autophagy, indicating roles in a general defect in lysosomal trafficking and degradation. In addition, loss of psenA/psenB and Aph-1 leads to an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, suggesting impaired protein degradation in these mutants. All of the endocytic defects in PSEN ortholog mutants can be fully restored by proteolytically inactive ''Dictyostelium'' PsenB and human PSEN1, demonstrating an evolutionarily conserved non-proteolytic role for presenilin in lysosomal trafficking and autophagy.

The next 6 unconventional myosins ([/gene/DDB_G0289177 myoF]), ''myoG'', ([/gene/DDB_G0289447 myoH]), ([/gene/DDB_G0274455 myoI]), ([/gene/DDB_G0272112 myoJ]), ([/gene/DDB_G0274575 myoK]) were recognized in large YAC clones that represent the whole genome [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7937787  (Titus et al. 1994)]. ''myoG'' encodes MyoG that carries a somewhat diverged version of the N-terminal motor domain, an IQ region for calmodulin ([/gene/DDB_G0279407 calA]) binding and a novel tail region which has two myosin tail homology domains (MyTH4) adjacent to a FERM domain [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20351273  (Breshears et al. 2010)]. MyoG is currently considered an orphan myosin. Strains with null mutations in ''myoG'' fail to develop and remain as smooth lawns; they appear to have cell autonomous defects in polarization and chemotaxis to cAMP and fail to activate PI3K at the anterior as occurs in wild type cells [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20351273  (Breshears et al. 2010)]. MyoG may play a role in membrane localization of RasGEF that limits its diffusion. Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 02-SEP-2019 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0273615	Petra Fey	The [/gene/DDB_G0269230 fpaA] and [/gene/DDB_G0273251 fpaB-1]/[/gene/DDB_G0273615 fpaB-2] genes encode nearly identical proteins, differing by one intron, 33 nucleotides, and one amino acid ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9373134 West et al. 1997]). The ''fpa'' genes encode the Skp1 protein, which in ''Dictyostelium'' and other protists forms the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex (reviewed in [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15238247 West et al. 2004]) Both FpaA and FpaB proteins are found in the cytoplasm and enriched in the nucleus in immunocytochemistry experiments.During development, expression persists in the nucleus but also increases at the cell cortex. Glycosylation is required for nuclear enrichment ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11358877 Sassi et al. 2001]).<br />Glycosylation of Skp1 has been extensively studied in ''Dictyostelium''. The initial step in Skp1 glycosylation involves the hydroxylation of Pro143 by a proline hydroxylase ([/gene/DDB_G0277759 phyA], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9660787 Teng-umnuay et al. 1998]). HyPro143 is then modified by the glycosyltransferase [/gene/DDB_G0275699 gnt1], which transfers a GlcNAc (N-acetylglucosamine) to the Skp1 protein ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10593934 Teng-umnuay et al. 1999]). The Skp1-GlcNAc is extended by a bifunctional diglycosyltransferase, [/gene/DDB_G0283761 pgtA], which processively adds galactose and fucose ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11423539 van der Wel et al. 2001], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12244067 van der Wel et al. 2002]).

DDB_G0267404	Robert Dodson	The motor domain in the kinesin encoded by ''kif6'' belongs to the MCAK subfamily of minus-end directed mitotic motors that are also able to catalyze the depolymerization of microtubules that occurs as chromosomes move towards the poles during anaphase [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9693369  (de Hostos et al. 1998)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14641909  (Kollmar and Glockner 2003)]. There is a SAM domain at the N-terminus that can associate with SAM domains in other proteins. The motor domain is central in Kif6. Reduction of ''kif6'' expression by regulated RNAi indicated that this kinesin plays a vital role in ''Dictyostelium''. As the level of Kif6 went down, many of the spindle assemblies became abnormal and the chromosomes were seen to lag during anaphase [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19286984  (Tikhonenko et al. 2009)]. Based on the sequences of the motor domains six of the 13 kinesins ([/gene/DDB_G0267396 kif2], [/gene/DDB_G0285101 kif4], ''kif6'', [/gene/DDB_G0291039 kif11], [/gene/DDB_G0268258 kif12], and [/gene/DDB_G0288361 kif13]) are members of mitotic motor families. Like each of the other mitotic kinesins, ''kif6'' mRNA levels are low in growing cells and increase to relatively high levels between 12 and 18 hrs of development before returning to very low levels [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9693369  (de Hostos et al. 1998)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 13-JUN-2017 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0279151	Robert Dodson	''cenB'' encodes a centrin which is 51% identical to CenA but is not localized to the centrosome. CenB is found throughout the nucleus in interphase cells but disappears as the cells enter mitosis even though the nuclear envelop does not fully breakdown during mitosis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20539780  (Mana-Capelli et al. 2010)]. Cells lacking CenB have enlarged nuclei with protrusions of the envelop and abnormal centrosome-nucleus anchoring. There are also supernumerary centrosomes and defects in the organization of the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) in the mutant cells. CenB appears to be required to maintain nuclear architecture during interphase and to be part of the machinery that regulates centrosome duplication.

DDB_G0272110	Robert Dodson	The ''gskA'' gene encodes the ''Dictyostelium'' homologue of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase. It is required for the cAMP induced formation of prespore cells and inhibition of stalk cells. Disruption of ''gskA'' creates a mutant that aggregates but forms few spores and an abnormally high number of stalk cells [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7813009  (Harwood et al. 1995)]. Extracellular cAMP activates GskA through the cAMP receptor cAR3 ([/gene/DDB_G0277829 carC]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9847246  (Plyte et al. 1999)] and the tyrosine kinase ZAK1 ([/gene/DDB_G0276025 zakA]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10571182  (Kim et al. 1999)], stimulating prespore differentiation. A second receptor, cAR4 ([/gene/DDB_G0277831 carD]), appears to negatively regulate GskA [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9284050  (Ginsburg and Kimmel, 1997)], to promote prestalk formation. GskA itself was shown to phosphorylate STATa ([/gene/DDB_G0281381 dstA]) and enhance its nuclear export [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11032815  (Ginger et al. 2000)]. There is also evidence that GskA phosphorylation activates the beta-catenin homologue aardvark ([/gene/DDB_G0288877 aarA]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11130075  (Crimson et al. 2000)].<br />It has been proposed that cAMP receptor-mediated pathways converge at GskA suggesting that the anterior (prestalk) / posterior (prespore) axis of ''Dictyostelium'' is regulated by an ancient mechanism that is shared by the Wnt/Fz circuits for dorsoventral patterning during early ''Xenopus'' development, and establishing ''Drosophila'' segment polarity [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9284050  (Ginsburg and Kimmel, 1997)]. In ''Dictyostelium'' it has been suggested that a single ligand, cAMP, activating receptors cAR3 and cAR4 with distinct affinities, alternatively either activates or inhibits, respectively, GskA-specific activity [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10980428  (Kim and Kimmel, 2000)].<br />While the original ''gskA''-null mutant was created in the uracil auxotroph DH1 strain, Schilde ''et al.'' deleted the gene in AX2. This had the advantage of creating a mutant with a milder phenotype, where a significant number of cells progress through development with relatively normal spore/stalk cell proportions. In this AX2/''gskA''-null strain, early development is accelerated but slug migration is impaired. Consistent with the accelerated early development, cell-specific markers [/gene/DDB_G0277853 ecmA], [/gene/DDB_G0269132 ecmB], and [/gene/DDB_G0267412 pspA] are precociously expressed. ''ecmB'' expression in wildtype is restricted to the slug tip, just as they commit themselves to stalk cell differentiation. In the AX2/''gskA''-null mutant, however, ''ecmB'' is expressed throughout the prestalk region of the slug, suggesting that ''gskA'' is involved in a repressive signalling pathway preventing premature stalk cell commitment. Microarray analysis identified the large gene C2 family ([/gene/DDB_G0280847 2C]) that requires ''gskA'' for optimal expression, suggesting that ''gskA'' may also play an activator role [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15342480  (Schilde et al. 2004)].<br />''gskA'' null mutants have aberrant aggregation and defective chemotaxis toward both cAMP and folate. In addition, ''gskA'' was shown to be required for both phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) and target of rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2)-mediated signalling. Furthermore, ''gskA'' null mutant cells do not generate cAMP pulses during aggregation, demonstrating that GskA plays a major role in the regulation of chemotaxis and early ''Dictyostelium'' development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20534815  (Teo et al. 2010)]. Using phosphoproteomics ([/gene/DDB_G0274383 pdeD]), ([/gene/DDB_G0283767 dct]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0293044 sogA]) were identified as substrates which are phosphorylated by GskA. Knockout mutants of all 3 genes are defective in chemotaxis. The carboxylesterase D2 ([/gene/DDB_G0276969 D2B]) is a downstream effector of GskA [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29626371  (Baumgardner et al. 2018)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 29-MAY-2007 PF
DDB_G0281871	Petra Fey	TSET is the latest addition to trafficking proteins, which is ancient but frequently lost or reduced in evolution. The TSET complex is a heterohexamer and was named for the protein subunits in the complex, TSPOON (sigma-like), TPLATE (beta-like), TCUP (mu-like), TSAUCER (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, zeta-like), TTRAY1, and TTRAY2. This ancient adaptor complex (AP) was identified in organisms such as Dictyostelids and land plants, such as ''Arabidopsis''. Only the TCUP subunit has been retained in fungi and animals, in mammals it has evolved into the cargo adaptor muniscin. A TSPOON-GFP fusion (gene tstD) has been shown to physically bind the 5 other TSET subunits. The TTRAY subunits form the scaffold for the TSPOON, TPLATE, TCUP, TSAUCER, heterotetramer.

DDB_G0289967	Robert Dodson	Sirtuins are evolutionarily conserved NAD-dependent protein deacetylases which play important roles in various biological processes. ''Dictyostelium'' Sir2D localizes to the nucleus and was found to be expressed throughout growth and development. Deletion of ''sir2D'' revealed a variety of defects in growth, development and autophagy. ''sir2D'' null cells have smaller aggregates, multi-tipped mounds, and display defects in both prestalk and prespore cell differentiation.

DDB_G0281569	Robert Dodson	''tor'' (Target Of Rapamycin) encodes the catalytic subunit of the protein kinase TOR which functions in two distinct complexes, TORC1 and TORC2. TORC1 is involved in nutrient sensing and growth, while TORC2 is involved in chemotaxis and relay of the cAMP signal. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10473630  (Lee et al. 1999)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16079174  (Lee et al. 2005)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22266904  (Rosel et al. 2012)]. TORC1 consists of Tor, Raptor ([/gene/DDB_G0270398 raptor]) and Lst8 ([/gene/DDB_G0292592 lst8]) while TORC2 consists of Tor, PiaA (Rictor) ([/gene/DDB_G0277399 piaA]), (Sin1) ([/gene/DDB_G0284611 ripA]) and Lst8 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22266904  (Rosel et al. 2012)]. Attempts to generate a ''tor'' knockout mutant were unsuccessful, suggesting that Tor is essential for cell survival. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26460541  (Swer et al. 2015)]. Activated RasC ([/gene/DDB_G0281385 rasC]) binds to the catalytic domain of tor and stimulates TORC2 to phosphorylate downstream protein kinases, PKB ([/gene/DDB_G0268620 pkbA]) and PKBR1 ([/gene/DDB_G0290157 pkgB]), as well as to activate adenylyl cyclase ([/gene/DDB_G0281545 acaA]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27172998  (Khanna et al. 2016)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18635356  (Kamimura et al. 2008)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20660630  (Cai et al. 2010)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19763972  (Kamimura et al. 2009)]. During chemotaxis to cAMP, RacE ([/gene/DDB_G0280975 racE]) promotes phosphorylation of PkbA and PkgB by assembling a supercomplex with RasC-GTP and the TORC2 components tor, piaA and lst8. This supercomplex formation is controlled by the chemoattractant-induced phosphorylation of racE at S192 by the glycogen synthase kinase gskA ([/gene/DDB_G0272110 gskA]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31263268  (Senoo et al. 2019)]. Only TORC1 is inhibited by rapamycin [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18651095  (Liao et al. 2008)]. Treatment of wild type Dictyostelium cells with rapamycin or antisense inhibition of Rheb ([/gene/DDB_G0277041 rheb])-an upstream TOR complex activator-mimicked the defective phenotypes of Tpp1 ([/gene/DDB_G0269914 tpp1]) knockdown mutants, supporting a role for TOR signaling in Batten disease [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31100984  (Smith et al. 2019)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 17-JUL-2019 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

DDB_G0292878	Robert Dodson	The Dictyostelium WASP family was first described by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20573979  Veltman and Insall 2010]. All WASH complex subunits have been identified, wshA, fam21, cdc53, strumpellin, and swip. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21606208  Carnell et al. 2011] found that WASH is responsible for V-ATPase retrieval and vesicle reneutralization before exocytosis. In wsh- knockout cells, neutralization of lysosomes to form post-lysosomes is blocked similar to when latrunculin inhibits F-actin polymerization. Furthermore, indigestible material such as dextran is not exocytosed. The actin mediated The V-ATPase recycling was the first shown lysosomal recycling function of WASH. <br />The role of WASH in lysosomal function was further assessed by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23885127  King et al. 2013]. They demonstrate that WASH is required for the lysosomal digestion of both phagocytic and autophagic cargo. wshA null cells are unable to grow on many bacteria, or to digest their own cytoplasm to survive starvation. Proteomic analysis of the wshA phagosome revealed a reduced delivery of lysosomal hydrolases, including both proteases and lipases, resulting in both reduced phagosomal proteolysis and lipid catabolism. Starvation-induced macroautophagy lead to phospholipid accumulation within WASH-null lysosomes, causing the formation of multilamellar bodies typical of many lysosomal storage diseases. In addition, cathepsin D becomes trapped in a late endosomal compartment, unable to be recycled to nascent phagosomes and autophagosomes, demonstrating that WASH is required for the maturation of lysosomes to a stage at which hydrolases can be retrieved and reused. <br />[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24119059  Kolonko et al. 2013] showed that after phagocytosis of mycobacteria, F-actin accumulates on the mycobacterial vacuole, and WASH is associated as F-actin nucleating factor. However, disruption of WASH or depolymerization of F-actin prevented F-actin coating the vesicle and thus the proton pumping V-ATPase gains access. The resulting acidification reduces the replication of mycobacteria. This demonstrates an evolutionarily conserved mechanism by which pathogenic mycobacteria subvert the actin-polymerization activity of WASH to prevent phagosome acidification and maturation, as a prerequisite to generate and maintain a replicative niche.<br />During phagocytosis and macropinocytosis bulk plasma membrane is internalized with its integrating proteins. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27647881  Buckley et al. 2016] addressed how WASH drives sorting and recycling from endosomes and is thus maintaining surface receptor levels and sustain phagocytosis. They report that WASH is recruited to both early and late phagosomes during maturation. By co-expression and mutant studies, the authors show that surface proteins such as p25 (''dynE'') or the integrins ''sibA'' and ''sibC'', are recycled via WASH early during phagocytosis, before acidification. In addition they demonstrate that WASH recycles the retromer complex, during both early and late stages of the endocytic cycle. <br />In ''wshA'' null cells, ''Legionella pneumophila'' replicates more efficiently than in wt cells, and the deletion of WASH strongly impairs the recruitment of Rab1 ([/gene/DDB_G0283757 rab1A]) and Rab8 ([/gene/DDB_G0280043 rab8A]) to Legionella-containing vacuoles (LCVs) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29602783 Welin et al. 2018]).

DDB_G0288679	Robert Dodson	Besides ''mhcA'' ([/gene/DDB_G0286355 mhcA]) that encodes the classical myosin heavy chain, ''Dictyostelium'' carries genes for 12 unconventional myosins. ''myoE'' encodes myosin 1E that, like myosin 1A ([/gene/DDB_G0280039 myoA]), has a truncated tail domain that does not bind F-actin [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8504170  (Urrutia et al. 1993)]. However, the tail region of MyoE, like that of MyoD ([/gene/DDB_G0275447 myoD]) and MyoF ([/gene/DDB_G0289177 myoF]), binds phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) resulting in its accumulation at the front of migrating cells where the PI3kinases are active and PTEN ([/gene/DDB_G0286557 pten]) is excluded [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22296834  (Chen et al. 2012)]. MyoE, like MyoA, uses multifunctional calmodulin ([/gene/DDB_G0279407 calA]) as a light chain [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21671662  (Crawley et al. 2011)]. Neither growth nor development are noticably affected by null mutations in ''myoE'' but double mutants carrying either ''myoD''-/''myoE''- and ''myoE''-/''myoF''- grow more slowly, aggregate more slowly and make misshapen fruiting bodies. Triple mutant cells lacking ''myoD'', ''myoE'' and ''myoF'' are defective in chemotaxis to cAMP, chemoattractant-stimulated actin polymerization and phagocytosis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22296834  (Chen et al. 2012)]. Both MyoE and MyoF localize to macropinocytic cups and actin waves [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26801966  (Brzeska et al. 2016)]. The amino acid sequences of MyoD, MyoE, and MyoF are more similar to each other than to other myosins; together they form a group of unconventional myosins involved in growth and development. Like ''myoD'' mRNA, ''myoE'' mRNA is abundant during the first two hours of development, decreases to a minimum at T=7 hrs and then reaccumulates to a peak at T=11 hrs. ''myoF'' mRNA is much less abundant [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 27-AUG-2019 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

These enzymes are not similar to any other known lysozymes. These aly enzymes are not similar to any other known lysozymes. It has been suggested that these proteins represent a new class of lysozymes [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15640146  (Mueller et al., 2005)].<br />A comprehensive study classified all lysozymes in ''Dictyostelium''.

Because in the past, gene models for these two new lysozymes gave rise to proteins with transmembrane domains, one or two respectively, they first have been named alyTM1 and alyTM2. However, new sequence analyses resulted in updated gene models coding for proteins containing signal peptides like the other 5 members of the aly family. Alignment of the 7 proteins allowed the identification of one conserved Asp and one Glu residue in the C- terminal portion [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32061941 (Lamrabet et al. 2020)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 29-APR-2020 PF

DDB_G0291291	Robert Dodson	''ecmF'' encodes a member of a multigene family of small extracellular cellulose binding proteins that includes EcmH ([/gene/DDB_G0292220 ecmH]) and ST15 ([/gene/DDB_G0292218 st15]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11488929 Wang et al. 2001)]. Their genes are only transcribed after 16 hours of development and are expressed uniquely in prestalk cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15309638 Shimada et al. 2004)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420 Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. Expression of ecmF is dependent on the transcription factor STATa ([/gene/DDB_G0281381 dstA]). Results published by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27125566  (Saga et al. 2016)] suggest that STATa regulation of ''ecmF'' is mediated by the transcription factor MybC ([/gene/DDB_G0281563 mybC]). Null mutations in ''ecmF'' have no observable consequences to development, most likely because of redundancy among members of the family ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15309638 Shimada et al. 2004)]. Since the slug sheath is made for several hours before ''ecmF'' is expressed, it is unlikely that EcmF is an essential sheath component, and more likely that it is involved in culmination.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-OCT-2016 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

DDB_G0267396	Robert Dodson	The motor domain in the kinesin encoded by ''kif2'' is at the C-terminus as is seen in members of the kinesin NCD/Kar3 subfamily of minus-end directed mitotic motors [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10854856  (Iwai et al. 2000)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14641909  (Kollmar and Glockner 2003)]. Based on the sequences of the motor domains, six of the 13 kinesins ([/gene/DDB_G0267396 kif2]), ([/gene/DDB_G0285101 kif4]), ([/gene/DDB_G0267404 kif6]), ([/gene/DDB_G0291039 kif11]), ([/gene/DDB_G0268258 kif12]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0288361 kif13]) are members of mitotic motor families. Like other members of the kinesin NCD/Kar3 subfamily, Kif2 appears to be a minus-end motor since it accumulates on the mitotic spindle during mitosis. ''kif2'' null cells grow and develop normally, suggesting that some of the vital functions of Kif2 can be provided by other microtubule motors [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10854856  (Iwai et al. 2000)]. However, expression of ''kif2'' under the control of the strong actin 15 promoter is lethal. Expression of ''kif2'' under the control of the weaker discoidin promoter causes partial mitotic arrest, suggesting that mitosis can be regulated by the level of this mitotic motor. Like each of the other mitotic kinesins, ''kif2'' mRNA levels are low in growing cells and increase to relatively high levels between 12 and 18 hrs of development before returning to very low levels [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9693369  (de Hostos et al. 1998)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 29-MAY-2017 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

DDB_G0279607	Robert Dodson	The mDia1-like formin A (''forA'') was identified as an actin assembly factor that contributes to the formation of the cortical actin network in the rear of migrating ''Dictyostelium discoideum'' cells. ForA localization to the rear of migrating cells is regulated by phosphoinositide gradients. ForA was shown to promote actin assembly and to be essential for the stability of cortical actin. ''forA'' null cells exhibit motility defects, which ''forA'' ''mhcA'' double mutants reveal to be dependent on myosin II activity. In addition, ForA was shown to prevent aberrant bleb formation in the posterior of migrating cells. Further results also indicate that ''Dictyostelium'' ''forA'' is the functional homolog of vertebrate ''mDia1'', suggesting a conserved mechanism in the generation of the rear cortex across species ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26415699 Ramalingam et al. 2015)].

DDB_G0267462	Robert Dodson	The ''Dd5P4'' gene encodes a type II inositol 5-phosphatase that has inositol-polyphosphate 5-phosphatase, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphatase and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 5-phosphatase activites ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12464622 Loovers et al. 2003]). ''Dd5P4'' null mutants exhibit slower growth in axenic media or on bacteria, aberrant development with multiple tipped aggregates, ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12464622 Loovers et al. 2003]), and a strongly reduced phagocytosis due to an inefficiency in closing the phagocytic cup and forming a phagosome. In addition to the N-terminal 5-phosphate catalytic domain, Dd5P4 contains a C-terminal RhoGAP domain. Mutation or deletion in either domain does not rescue the mutant phenotypes while full length Dd5P4 does restore all lost functions. In addition, the human protein OCRL partially rescues the phagocytosis phenotype whereas a mutated OCRL does not, indicating that human OCRL can functionally replace ''Dictyostelium'' Dd5P4, ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17343681 Loovers et al. 2007]). In cells lacking Dd5P4, depletion of PI(3,4)P2 leads to increased Ras activity, cell spreading and aberrant migratory behavior ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30194235 Li et al. 2018]). <br />Dd5P4 also plays a role during bacterial infection. Dd5P4 localizes to ''Legionella''-containing vacuoles (LCVs), and in ''Dd5P4'' null cells, intracellular replication of ''Legionella pneumophila'' initiates earlier and proceeds at a higher rate compared with wt cells. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19021631 Weber et al. 2009]).

DDB_G0275699	Petra Fey	GNT1 is the first of three glycosyltransferases to modify Skp1. ''Dictyostelium'' acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity was originally identified in the cytoplasm ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10593934 Teng-umnuay et al. 1999]). This activity was later attributed to the [/gene/DDB_G0275699 gnt1] gene ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12244115 van der Wel et al. 2002]). GNT1 specifically adds GlcNAc (N-acetylglucosamine) to Skp1 ([/gene/DDB_G0269230 fpaA]/[/gene/DDB_G0273251 fpaB-1])<br />Glycosylation of Skp1 has been extensively studied in ''Dictyostelium''. The initial step in Skp1 glycosylation involves the hydroxylation of Pro143 by a proline hydroxylase ([/gene/DDB_G0277759 phyA], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9660787 Teng-umnuay et al. 1998]). HyPro143 is then modified by the glycosyltransferase [/gene/DDB_G0275699 gnt1], which transfers a GlcNAc (N-acetylglucosamine) to the Skp1 protein ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10593934 Teng-umnuay et al. 1999]). The Skp1-GlcNAc is extended by a bifunctional diglycosyltransferase, [/gene/DDB_G0283761 pgtA], which processively adds galactose and fucose ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11423539 van der Wel et al. 2001], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12244067 van der Wel et al. 2002]). Subsequently two additional galactose residues are added by [/gene/DDB_G0283005 agtA] to yield the Skp1 pentasaccharide (GGFGGnOSkp1; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16495217 Ercan et al. 2006], reviewed in [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128470 West and Kim 2019]).<br />Genetic disruption of ''gnt1'' results in an oxygen requirement for culmination that lies between that of the phyA-KO (gene [/gene/DDB_G0277759 phyA]) and wild type cells, but also yields morphologically defective fruiting bodies at any oxygen level ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22128189 Zhang et al. 2011]). Further investigations showed that full SKP1 glycosylation is required for optimal oxygen sensing during development, for example [/gene/DDB_G0283005 agtA] knockout and overexpression mutants require an elevated oxygen level to culminate, similar to the phenotype of the [/gene/DDB_G0277759 phyA] mutant ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19687007 Wang et al. 2009], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22128189 Zhang et al. 2011], reviewed in [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25988702 West and Blader 2015]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-MAR-2020 PF
DDB_G0267422	Robert Dodson	''tipC'' was isolated from a REMI mutant that was picked because its development was arrested when multiple tips formed on aggregates ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10402673 Stege et al. 1999)]. It encodes a large protein with a C-terminal domain similar to the one in yeast and human vacuolar sorting protein VPS13. This protein is involved in the transport of proteins to the vacuole in yeast. The human protein VPS13A is mutated in the neurodegenerative disease chorea-acanthocytosis. ''tipC'' null mutants have a reduced number of autophagosomes as visualized by punctate GFP-ATG8 and GFP-ATG18 as well as defects in autophagy flux ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25996471 Munoz-Braceras et al. 2015)]. Further analysis of VPS13 in human cells confirmed the participation of the human protein in autophagy.'' tipC'' null mutants have abnormal cell sorting behavior and severely reduced fruiting body and spore production. The multi-tipped phenotype of ''tipC'' null mutants is similar to that of mutants in other autophagy genes ''atg6'' ([/gene/DDB_G0269244 atg6A]), ''atg7'' ([/gene/DDB_G0271096 atg7]), ''atg9'' ([/gene/DDB_G0285323 atg9]), ''atg101'' ([/gene/DDB_G0288287 atg101]), and ''tipD'' ([/gene/DDB_G0275323 tipD]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 23-FEB-2017 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis and Ricardo Escalante
DDB_G0284863	Robert Dodson	The ''limB'' gene was isolated from a REMI mutant picked for being unable to form a tip on mounds ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10749929 Chien et al. 2000)]. The gene encodes a protein with 5 repeats of the conserved zinc-finger LIM domain and is expressed during early development. The protein is found in the plasma membrane where it may regulate the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10749929 Chien et al. 2000)]. ''limB'' null cells exhibit an aberrant actin cytoskeleton, poor adhesion to a substratum and do not form tight cell-cell agglomerates in suspension. ''limB'' null cells are also unable to properly polarize in chemoattractant gradients and have a decreased chemotaxis rate. The mound arrest phenotype can be overcome by expression of ''limB'' under the control of the regulatory region of a prestalk specific gene, but not when it is under the control of the regulatory region of a prespore specific gene, indicating that tip formation may be driven by prestalk cells alone.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 03-FEB-2017 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

DDB_G0289117	Robert Dodson	Besides ''mhcA'' ([/gene/DDB_G0286355 mhcA]) that encodes the classical myosin heavy chain, ''Dictyostelium'' carries genes for 12 unconventional myosins. ''myoB'' encodes myosin IB which has an N-terminal 45 kDa motor domain with an actin-activated ATPase and a carboxy terminal domain that is rich in glycine, proline and alanine and can bind to filamentous actin [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2762320  (Jung et al. 1989)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2519618  (Titus et al. 1989)]. A basic region in the tail is predicted to bind to acidic phospholipids in the plasma membrane [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24747353  (Brzeska et al. 2014)]. MyoB associates with a 8-kDa light chain encoded by ''mlcB'' ([/gene/DDB_G0290077 mlcB]) that has about 30% sequence identity with calmodulin [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16415352  (Crawley et al. 2006)]. ''myoB'' mRNA is abundant during the first two hours of development, decreases to a minimum at T=6 hrs and then reaccumulates to a peak at T=11 hrs. ''mlcB'' is coordinately expressed.[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)].<br />MyoB is non-filamentous and concentrates in F-actin structures of anterior pseudopods of polarized cells where it may move actin filaments relative to the membrane [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2797149  (Fukui et al. 1989)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2519618  (Titus et al. 1989)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22367211  (Brzeska et al. 2012)]. Phosphorylation of serine 322 in response to the chemoattractant cAMP increases movement of MyoB on F-actin [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11084033  (Gliksman et al. 2001)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18089562  (Tsiavaliaris et al. 2008)]. MyoB may also be involved in recycling of plasma membrane components from endosomes back to the cell surface [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10973992  (Neuhaus and Soldati, 2000)].<br />Cells lacking MyoB turn twice as frequently as wild type cells and have reduced efficiency of chemotaxis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1666340  (Wessels et al. 1991)]. Fluid phase dextran uptake by pinocytosis is normal in cells lacking MyoA ([/gene/DDB_G0280039 myoA]) MyoB or MyoC ([/gene/DDB_G0276617 myoC]), but is impaired in cells lacking both MyoA and MyoB or both MyoB and MyoC suggesting that myosin I isoforms function cooperatively [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8522584  (Novak et al. 1995)]. The double null mutants ''myoA''/''myoB'' and ''myoB''/''myoC'' are covered in spikey filopodia suggesting that these myosin Is may have a role in limiting the extension of processes. MyoB and MyoC have been found in a complex containing p116, ([/gene/DDB_G0292386 carmil]), capping protein ([/gene/DDB_G0267374 acpA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0272104 acpB]) and the Arp2/3 nucleating complex indicating that these myosin Is may be involved in recruiting the machinery responsible for F-actin nucleation and elongation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11425877  (Jung et al. 2001)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12753645  (Soldati, 2003)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 13-AUG-2019 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0285323	Robert Dodson	''atg9'' was isolated together with several other members of the autophagy family of genes, conserved from yeast to man ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12626495 Otto et al. 2003)]. Macroautophagy is used to recycle cellular components during starvation and development. ATG9 has 6 transmembrane domains and is found on small vesicles where it may be involved in membrane trafficking to autophagosomes ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20603609 Calvo-Garrido et al. 2010)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20070309 Tung et al. 2010)]. ''atg9'' is rapidly induced during early development and is necessary for normal morphogenesis. Growth is somewhat impaired in mutant cells lacking ATG9. Aggregates of cells lacking ATG9 have multiple tips and generate long, thin slugs that often break up and make only a few small misshapen fruiting bodies ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20070309 Tung et al. 2010)]. The multi-tipped phenotype of ''atg9'' mutants is similar to that of mutants in other autophagy genes ''atg6'', ([/gene/DDB_G0269244 atg6A]) ''atg7'', ([/gene/DDB_G0271096 atg7]) ''atg101'', ([/gene/DDB_G0288287 atg101]) ''tipC'', ([/gene/DDB_G0267422 tipC]) and ''tipD'' ([/gene/DDB_G0275323 tipD]). The rate of phagocytosis of bacteria and yeast is also reduced in ''atg9''- mutant cells. A similar reduction is also seen in the atg16 mutant, ([/gene/DDB_G0275323 tipD]), suggesting that autophagy might be involved in the efficient degradation of bacteria ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25878144 Xiong et al. 2015)]. Although uptake of the intercellular pathogen ''Legionella pneumophila'' is reduced 8 fold, those bacteria that get into the ''atg9''- mutant cells are more successful in establishing a replicative niche and replicating ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20070309 Tung et al. 2010)]. Transcripts of ''atg9'', ''atg8'' and ''tipD'' accumulate following infection with Legionella suggesting a protective role for autophagy in ''D. discoideum'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16469056 Farbrother et al. 2006)]. Mutants lacking ''atg9'', ''atg5'' ([/gene/DDB_G0289881 atg5]) and ''atg7'' ([/gene/DDB_G0271096 atg7]) are impaired in cAMP induction of prespore gene expression, indicating that autophagy is required for this process ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31051160 Yamada et al. 2019)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 10-DEC-2019 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis and Ricardo Escalante

DDB_G0277903	Robert Dodson	Unlike most of the spore coat proteins, SP65 (''cotE'') is not synthesized during the slug stage and stored in prespore vesicles (PSVs), but is synthesized during culmination just-in-time to be incorporated into spore coats [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10564654  (Zhang et al. 1999)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17416892  (Metcalf et al. 2007)]. SP65 is secreted from prespore cells in fruiting bodies and forms a complex with SP85 ([/gene/DDB_G0276939 pspB]) and cellulose that makes up the inner and middle layers of the spore coats. In the absence of SP85, SP65 is found in the interspore matrix. Mutants lacking SP65 have defects in the outer layer of the spore coat which makes them more permeable [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17416892  (Metcalf et al. 2007)]. Expression of ''cotE'' is dependent on the transcription factor BzpF ([/gene/DDB_G0279529 bzpF]) that is related to the mammalian DNA binding protein CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21810415  (Huang et al. 2011)].

DDB_G0270218	Robert Dodson	GlkA is a GSK family protein kinase that is required for the proper regulation of growth, chemotaxis, and multicellular development. GlkA and the protein kinase ([/gene/DDB_G0272110 gskA]) have overlapping functions involved in controlling chemotaxis and early development. Both kinases regulate the cytoskeleton through MyoII assembly and the control of ([/gene/DDB_G0291237 rapA]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0293434 rasG]) function. However PKBR1 ([/gene/DDB_G0290157 pkgB]) regulation and PI3K and PH-CRAC translocation are affected in ''gskA'' null but not in ''glkA'' null cells, suggesting that GskA and GlkA also have independent functions. In addition, ''glkA'' null phenotypes are only observed in cells that are grown attached to a substratum and not in cells grown in suspension culture, suggesting that GlkA is involved in mediating cell adhesion signaling responses during growth in Dictyostelium.

DDB_G0292262	Robert Dodson	Besides ''mhcA'' that encodes the classical myosin heavy chain, ''Dictyostelium'' carries genes for 12 unconventional myosins. ''myoM'', the last unconventional myosin gene discovered, encodes a large protein with a N-terminal myosin motor domain and a C-terminal RhoGEF domain [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10403059  (Schwarz et al. 1999)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10828443  (Oishi et al. 2000)]. There is also a PH-domain at the C-terminal that could localize MyoM to acidic membrane lipids such as PIP2. The C-terminal domain was directly shown to catalyze nucleotide exchange and activation of Rac1 GTPases that induce actin-driven surface protrusions [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11208126  (Geissler et al. 2000)]. Mutant strains lacking MyoM had no observable defects in either growth or development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10828443  (Oishi et al. 2000)]. However mutant strains overexpressing MyoM displayed defects in growth and development, and an aberrant response to osmotic stress. The combination of a myosin motor domain and an active Rac-GEF domain suggests a possible role for MyoM at the interface of Rac-mediated signal transduction and remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11208126  (Geissler et al. 2000)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 17-SEP-2019 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

DDB_G0284363	Petra Fey	Developing ''Dictyostelium'' cells aggregate to form fruiting bodies containing typically 2 x 10(4) cells. To prevent the formation of an excessively large fruiting body, streams of aggregating cells break up into groups if there are too many cells. The breakup is regulated by a secreted complex of polypeptides called counting factor (CF). CF is composed of 4 polypeptides, including Countin (encoded by the [/gene/DDB_G0274597 ctnA] gene), cf50, [/gene/DDB_G0269248 cf45-1] and [/gene/DDB_G0284363 cf60]. CF60 has been purified and sequenced from the conditioned medium (CM) 450 kDa complex. Anti-CF60 antibodies stained a 60-kDa protein that fractionated as a broad peak at about 450 kDa from wild-type CM and a broad peak at approximately 175 to 150 kDa from ''cf50-'' CM indicating that CF60 is part of an extracellular 450-kDa complex whose apparent size decreases when CF50 is absent. This suggests that CF60 is a component of CF. Knockout ''cf60-'' have been inviable, died after a few days and could not be recovered on a bacterial lawn. Therefore, antisense and over-expression mutants have been created. CM from mild ''cf60as'' cells slightly increased group size while CM from ''cf60oe'' cells significantly decreased group size, in line with phenotypes of ctnA, cf50 and cf45-1 mutants. Also, the effect of CF60 on group size seem to require the presence of CF50 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16963635 (Brock et al. 2006)]. CF and group size have also been mathematically modeled [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16371424 (Dallon et al. 2006)], which together with experimental evidence has been reviewed in [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18426773 Jang and Gomer 2008].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 06-APR-2020 PF
DDB_G0269176	Robert Dodson	''racF1'' encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Rho family of small GTPases. G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Ras GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. The Rac GEF GxcT ([/gene/DDB_G0269610 gxcT]) binds to and may also activate RacE ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24248334 Wang et al. 2013]). The myosin heavy chain kinase PakB ([/gene/DDB_G0276459 pakB]) interacts with and is a potential downstream effector of RacF1 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15509655 de la Roche et al. 2005]). <br />RacF1 shares 94 percent sequence identity with another ''Dictyostelium'' Rho GTPase, RacF2 ([/gene/DDB_G0276967 racF2]). ''racF1'' mRNA is expressed throughout the life cycle: a 0.7 kb transcript is present in vegetative cells, and a 0.9 kb transcript is constitutively expressed throughout the developmental cycle. RacF1 is distributed uniformly in the cytosol and is transiently associated with macropinosomes and phagosomes. When two cells come in contact, RacF1 is strongly enriched in the cortex in the contact area as long as the cells remain attached. ''racF1'' null mutant cells display no prominent phenotypes, and RacF1 does not appear to be essential for endocytosis, cytokinesis or development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10198067 Rivero et al. 1999)]. RacF1 and RacF2 are likely to have redundant roles in sexual cell fusion. Analysis of ''racF2'' null and overexpression mutants suggest that the gene affects sexual cell fusion and asexual development through the regulation of EDTA-sensitive cell-cell adhesion. ''racF1'' is also induced during sexual cell maturation, although to a lesser extent than ''racF2'', and the RacF1 protein accumulates transiently at cell-cell contact sites, compatible with a role in cell-cell adhesion regulation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16573737 Muramoto et al. 2006]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26940518 Rivero et al. 2016]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-MAY-2020 RD

DDB_G0283757	Robert Dodson	''rab1A'' encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Rab family of small GTPases. G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rab GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Rab GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. Rab1A binds to the leucine-rich repeat kinase Roco2 ([/gene/DDB_G0273259 qkgA-1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0273635 qkgA-2]) which serves as a downstream effector of Rab1A ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21551065 Kicka et al. 2011]). ''rab1A'' is expressed at detectable levels in growing cells and expression remains constant at approximately the same level during development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8294041 Bush et al. 1993]). Rab1A localizes to the pseudopodium ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21551065 Kicka et al. 2011]) and the Legionella-containing vacuole [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18980612  (Urwyler et al. 2009)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29602783  (Welin et al. 2018)]. Rab1A is highly similar to human Rab1A and Rab1B, which are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking. <br />''rab1A'' is involved in a signaling pathway that controls the actin cytoskeleton and pseudopod extension, and thereby, cell polarity and motility. Roco2 is activated in response to chemoattractant stimulation, localizes to the pseudopodium, and binds to both Rab1A and filamin ([/gene/DDB_G0269100 abpC]). Constitutively active Rab1A pulls down 5 x more Roco2 than wild type Rab1A while dominant-negative Rab1A fails to interact with it, suggesting that activated Rab1A positively regulates Roco2 activity. Both Roco2 null mutants and dominant-negative Rab1A cells have defects in chemotaxis to cAMP and aberrant chemoattractant-mediated F-actin polymerization, and constitutively active Rab1A cells produce extended pseudopodia and make an increased number of turns during chemotaxis. These results reveal a signal transduction pathway in which Rab1A activates Roco2 kinase which in turn mediates cell polarization and chemotaxis by regulating cortical F-actin polymerization and pseudopod extension. Filamin serves as a downstream effector of Roco2 to control pseudopod extension ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21551065 Kicka et al. 2011]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 26-AUG-2020 RD

DDB_G0291356	Robert Dodson	''grlE'' encodes a member of the evolutionarily conserved family of seven transmembrane receptors that are coupled to G-proteins ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16735079 Prabhu and Eichinger, 2006)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16527814 Taniura et al. 2006)]. GrlE is most similar to metazoan GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors. GrlE is the major GABA receptor during late development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23548898 Wu et al. 2013)], and spore differentiaton factor 2 (SDF-2) production is abolished in ''grlE'' null cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16672332 Anjard and Loomis, 2006)]. When GABA binds GrlE coupled to Galpha 7 ([/gene/DDB_G0276455 gpaG]) during culmination, PI3 kinases are activated leading to activation of the protein kinase PKB R1 ([/gene/DDB_G0290157 pkgB]) which then triggers release of the SDF-2 precursor AcbA ([/gene/DDB_G0270658 acbA]) from prespore cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16672332 Anjard and Loomis, 2006)]. Before GABA is synthesized in prespore cells, glutamate is bound to GrlE which inhibits release of AcbA. The glutamate-bound form of GrlE is coupled to Galpha 9 ([/gene/DDB_G0283419 gpaI]). When GABA displaces glutamate bound to GrlE on prestalk cells, it induces exposure of the protease domain of TagC ([/gene/DDB_G0286121 tagC]) such that it can convert AcbA to SDF-2 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16672332 Anjard and Loomis, 2006)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 15-DEC-2016 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis; annotation contributions PMID:23548898 Chris Janetopoulos

Cellulose is found in the extracellular matrix that surrounds ''Dictyostelium'' slugs as well as in the cell walls of spores and stalk cells. The ''dcsA'' gene was isolated from a REMI mutant that fails to accumulate cellulose at any stage of development. DcsA has a transmembrane domain with 3 hydrophobic regions that is essential for proper function [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25208883  (Kuwayama et al. 2014)]. mRNA starts to accumulate from ''dcsA'' after aggregation is complete (T=11 hrs) and reaches a peak during culmination at T=20 hrs [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. This pattern is consistent with the flux-balance model of carbohydrate metabolism during development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/988019  (Loomis and Thomas, 1976)]. Cells in which ''dcsA'' is disrupted can form migrating slugs that initiate culmination, but cannot form fruiting bodies because they collapse due to the lack of cellulose in the stalk as they try to stand up [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10681463  (Blanton et al. 2000)]. After some time, they make small, round spore-like cells, but these do not have the spore coats like those observed on the outside of wild type spores because their spore coat proteins are not organized around a central layer of cellulose [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11428129  (Zhang et al. 2001)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 15-MAR-2017 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0281969	Robert Dodson	MybE is responsible for expression of prestalk genes in PstO cells at the slug stage and stalk genes in lower cup cells during culminants [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16571632  (Fukuzawa et al. 2006)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17237363  (Tsujioka et al. 2007)]. MybE was purified from nuclear extracts of slug cells by affinity chromotography to a 30 bp region from the regulatory region of ecmA ([/gene/DDB_G0277853 ecmA]) that is essential for expression in PstO cells. The carboxy terminal portion of MybE has a region of regularly spaced tryptophan residues that is found in the Myb family of DNA binding proteins followed by a conserved motif that occurs predominantly in Myb proteins of plants but is also found in those of fish and reptiles. There are 6 other genes in Dictyostelium encoding additional members of this family. MybE binds preferentially to the dyad AACTGTT followed by a C-rich region found in the regulatory regions of both ''ecmA'' and ecmB ([/gene/DDB_G0269132 ecmB]). Mutants in which mybE is knocked out grow and aggregate normally but form long, thin slugs that often fragment [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16571632  (Fukuzawa et al. 2006)]. The proportion of prestalk cells appears to be reduced in these slugs.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 02-MAR-2018 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0269112	Robert Dodson	''celB'' is expressed coordinately with ''celA'' ([/gene/DDB_G0271134 celA]) in prespore cells as they start to encapsulate during culmination and later during germination [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1976383  (Giorda et al. 1990)]. ''celB'' encodes a 55 kDa protein with tandem copies of the unusual tetrapeptide repeat (TETP) and a cellulose binding domain like CelA but no measurable cellulase activity [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9334183  (Ramalingam and Ennis, 1997)]. About 600 bp upstream of the translation start sites of both ''celA'' and ''celB'' there is an 81 bp region sufficient for control of spore-specific transcription that includes the binding site (TAACTG) recognized by Myb transcription factors of ''Dictyostelium'' [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9334183  (Ramalingam and Ennis, 1997)]. It is likely that both celA and celB are repressed by a Myb factor. Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 04-OCT-2018 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0291241	Robert Dodson	Mutations in ''modB'' (''gnt2'') were isolated by screening cells for loss of a post-translational modification on the cell-cell adhesion molecule gp80 ([/gene/DDB_G0289073 csaA]) that is recognized by a monoclonal antibody [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6717432  (Murray et al. 1984)]. Multiple glycoproteins were found to be affected in ''modB''- mutants indicating that the gene is responsible for a common post-translational modification [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3902823  (West and Loomis, 1985)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2580746  (Loomis et al. 1985)]. Spores of ''modB''- null strains are more permeable to ricin which binds internal carbohydrates, indicating that the structure of their spore coats is abnormal [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1692841  (Aparicio et al. 1990)]. Based on genetic complementation studies, a clone carrying the ''modB'' locus was recognized among those that affected cisplatin resistance. The clone was found to encode a protein closely related to a previously recognized GlcNAc transferase, ''gnt1'' ([/gene/DDB_G0275699 gnt1]), and shown to generate O-linked GlcNAc modifications on SP29 ([/gene/DDB_G0267412 pspA]) and SP85 ([/gene/DDB_G0276939 pspB]) by transfer of GlcNAc from UDPGlcNAc to serine or threonine [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14551185  (Wang et al. 2003)]. Consequently, the locus name was changed to ''gnt2''. The gene product is a transmembrane protein that is localized to the Golgi apparatus where it generates mucin-type O-glycosylation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15616122  (Ercan and West, 2005)]. The original nitrosoguanidine induced mutation in ''modB'' resulted in a stop codon upstream of the catalytic domain.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 25-JAN-2019 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

DDB_G0267650	Robert Dodson	During endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER lumen. A highly regulated pathway known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) has evolved to restore ER homeostasis. The putative serine/threonine protein kinase ''ireA'' is orthologous to the highly conserved IRE1 gene which is involved in the regulation of the UPR. IreA was found to localize to the ER, and ''ireA'' null cells fail to cope with ER stress, displaying lysed cells with poor growth and collapsed ER cisternae. In addition, IreA participates in an ER stress-induced transcriptional response which modulates the levels of a diverse set of transcripts. In control cells, ER stress triggers autophagy and autophagy is also induced in ''ireA'' null cells, demonstrating that ''ireA'' is not required for autophagy induction. However in ''ireA'' cells, autophagosomes are persistent, abnormal and trapped at the ER, suggesting that they are unable to degrade autophagic cargoes and that IreA-mediated recovery of ER homeostasis is required to achieve a fully functional autophagy-dependent degradation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29632077 Ongay-Larios et al. 2018]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29890774 Dominguez-Martin et al. 2018]). Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 24-OCT-2019 RD
DDB_G0267406	Robert Dodson	A REMI screen to find suppressor mutants for the developmental phenotype of profilin null cells identified the ''lmpA'' gene. LmpA is homologous to mammalian CD36/LIMP-II, a member of the class B of scavenger receptors. LmpA specifically binds to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10189376  (Karakesisoglou et al. 1999)]. Disruption of ''lmpA'' in the profilin double null background ([/gene/DDB_G0287125 proA], [/gene/DDB_G0286187 proB]) suppressed the profilin null endocytic defects and phagocytic increases, suggesting that LmpA may act as a negative regulator of profilin [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10848626  (Temesvari et al. 2000)]. ''lmpA'' knockout mutants reveal a role for ''lmpA'' in phagocytosis and phagolysosome biosynthesis. ''lmpA'' null cells are highly affected by actin-dependent processes such as bacterial particle uptake and cell motility. The cells are also impaired in pinocytosis, phagosomal acidification, reneutralization and proteolysis, and also contain a reduced level of lysosomal hydrolases. In addition, ''lmpA'' null cells are more susceptible to infection by pathogenic ''Mycobacterium marinum''. Lmp localizes to macropinosomes, lysosomes, post-lysosomes and ''M. marinum''-containing vacuoles, further supporting its role in phagocytosis and host cell defense [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30054386  (Sattler et al. 2018)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10848626  (Temesvari et al. 2000)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-DEC-2019 RD

DDB_G0292998	Robert Dodson	''rasB'' encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Ras family of small GTPases. G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs, rasGEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs, rasGAPs) inactivate Ras GTPases. RasB is activated by the RasGEF Q ([/gene/DDB_G0289665 gefQ]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18504297 Mondal et al. 2008)] and inactivated by the RasGAP DdNF1 ([/gene/DDB_G0271750 nfaA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18948008 Zhang et al. 2008)].<br />''rasB'' is expressed at maximum levels during vegetative growth and the first 8 hr of development, and is activated upon cAMP stimulation by rasGEF Q. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8455930 Daniel et al. 1993)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18504297 Mondal et al. 2008)]. RasB is predominantly localized in the nucleus during most of the cell cycle but assumes a diffuse cellular localization during mitosis and cytokinesis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11606416 Sutherland et al. 2001)]. Constitutively active RasB mutants have an increased proportion of multi-nucleated cells, revealing a defect in cytokinesis. ''rasB'' null cells are unstable and exhibit growth defects, defects in both phagocytosis and macropinocytosis, and decreased F-actin levels in the phagocytic cup ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11606416 Sutherland et al. 2001)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27821733 Junemann et al. 2016)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967009 Williams et al. 2019)].<br />Ras signaling through RasB is a critical mediator of several processes in ''Dictyostelium'': the regulation of myosin II assembly, cytokinesis, and actin assembly during phagocytosis. Both rasGEF Q and constitutively active RasB directly interact with the myosin heavy chain kinase MHCK-A ([/gene/DDB_G0291231 mhkA]) to regulate myosin II assembly ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18504297 Mondal et al. 2008)]. RasB and RasG ([/gene/DDB_G0293434 rasG]) regulate cytokinesis through the protein kinase NdrC ([/gene/DDB_G0284839 ndrC]). ''ndrC'' null cells also display a cytokinesis defect and pull-down assays show that NdrC binds both activated RasG and RasB. The aberrant cytokinesis phenotype of activated RasB suggests that RasB is a negative regulator of cytokinesis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24986648 Mueller-Taubenberger et al. 2014)]. Null mutants of rasGAP NfaA are also reported to display cytokinesis defects. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18948008 Zhang et al. 2008)]. Similar to the ''rasB'' null mutant phenotype, ablation of the actin filament elongator formin G ([/gene/DDB_G0277175 forG]) results in significantly decreased phagocytosis and aberrant F-actin organization within phagosomes. Constitutively active RasB and RasG accumulate in endocytic cups where they directly interact with and regulate formin G, thus linking Ras GTPase signaling with actin polymerization in phagocytosis and macropinocytosis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27821733 Junemann et al. 2016)].

During interphase cytosolic centrosomes are connected to nuclei by fibrous bridges which carry CenA at both ends. The bridges disappear at metaphase when centrosomes enter fenestra in the nuclear envelope to organize microtubule spindles [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15548420  (Graf et al. 2004)]. CenA may help maintain association of the nucleus-associated centrosome with clustered chromosomal centromeres within the nucleus [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25952183  (Graf et al. 2015)]. About 100 different proteins contribute to centrosomal functions including the products of ([/gene/DDB_G0271738 tubC]), ([/gene/DDB_G0285849 spc97]), ([/gene/DDB_G0283909 spc98]), ''cenA'', ([/gene/DDB_G0288375 lis1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0270814 nek2]), ([/gene/DDB_G0283607 eb1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0268616 cepJ]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0278809 cepG]).

DDB_G0274595	Robert Dodson	''catA'' encodes the catalase that converts methanol to the toxic compounds formaldehyde and formic acid such that cells cannot grow in the presence of 2% methanol [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11004503  (Garcia et al. 2000)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11782526  (Garcia et al. 2002)]. Mutations in ''catA'' that inactivate the enzyme make the cells methanol resistant (metR). The metR phenotype is a useful recessive marker in parasexual genetics of ''Dictyostelium'' that can be easily selected. Mutants with little or no catalase activity in vegetative cells grow and develop normally but are hypersensitive to oxidative stress from hydrogen peroxide which is normally converted to harmless oxygen and water by catalase [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2921242  (Madigan and Katz 2002)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11004503  (Garcia et al. 2000)]. Curcumin reduces catalase A enzyme levels and negatively regulates ''catA'' mRNA levels, an effect that is mediated by PKA ([/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC], [/gene/DDB_G0279413 pkaR]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29135990  (Swatson et al. 2017)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 27-SEP-2018 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0288319	Robert Dodson	''arcE'' encodes the 16 kDa subunit of the Arp2/3 complex [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11807934  (Insall et al. 2001)]. The seven subunits of this 200 kDa complex are encoded by ([/gene/DDB_G0277825 arcA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0282813 arcB]), ([/gene/DDB_G0292804 arcC]), ([/gene/DDB_G0269102 arcD]) ''arcE'', ([/gene/DDB_G0272106 arpB]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0283755 arpC]). The subunits of mammalian Arp2/3 are very similar to ''Dictyostelium'' homologs. Arp2/3 binds to the side of F-actin filaments and initiates polymerization of a new F-actin chain at an angle of 70 degrees leading to a branched actin network that can alter the shape of cells. The ability to nucleate new actin filaments is greatly stimulated by direct interactions with members of the WASP/SCAR family [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11807934  (Insall et al. 2001)]. The Arp2/3 complex largely mediates the actin polymerization response to chemotactic stimulation and contributes to cell motility, pseudopod extension and adhesion in Dictyostelium chemotaxis. The complete Arp2/3 complex is essential for growth; partial loss of activity of either ArcB or ArpB impairs growth and chemotaxis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17553489  (Langridge and Kay, 2007)]. mRNA from each of the genes encoding Arp2/3 subunits accumulates coordinately to reach a peak at 3 hours of development and gradually decreases thereafter [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. The Arp2/3 complex interacts with the protein CARMIL, which serves as a scaffold for the assembly of a larger complex of proteins involved in the nucleation and termination of actin filament assembly. The complex consists of CARMIL ([/gene/DDB_G0292386 carmil]), AcpA, ([/gene/DDB_G0267374 acpA]) AcpB, ([/gene/DDB_G0272104 acpB]) the Arp2/3 complex, and type I myosins MyoB ([/gene/DDB_G0289117 myoB]) and MyoC ([/gene/DDB_G0276617 myoC]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11425877  (Jung et al. 2001)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 30-MAY-2019 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0293834	Robert Dodson	The WASP/SCAR family of adaptor proteins regulates actin polymerization by coupling Rho-family GTPases to the activation of the Arp2/3 complex [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15506982  (Blagg and Insall, 2004)]. The homolog of WASP (Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome protein) in ''Dictyostelium'' is encoded by ''wasA''. Cells expressing reduced levels of ''wasA'' showed reduced F-actin levels and significant defects in organizing polarized F-actin assembly, resulting in an inability to establish axial polarity during chemotaxis. WASP preferentially localizes at the leading edge and uropod of chemotaxing cells [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15728724  (Myers et al. 2005)]. In wild type cells, WASP is involved in vesicle trafficking from the Golgi to the surface membrane [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19409937  (Lee et al. 2009)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20573979  (Veltman and Insall, 2010)]. WASP has been seen at clathrin-coated pits rather than associated with pseudopods. However, in SCAR-depleted mutants ([/gene/DDB_G0285253 scrA]), WASP replaces the functions of SCAR and localizes to pseudopods where it stimulates the Arp2/3 complex to initiate dendritic growth of F-actin. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22891261  (Veltman et al. 2012)]. Cells lacking both SCAR and WASP are unable to grow, make pseudopods or migrate using blebs, however actin polymerization is normal. Pseudopods are replaced in double SCAR/WASP mutants by aberrant filopods, induced by the formin dDia2 ([/gene/DDB_G0285589 forH]). Further disruption of dDia2 in SCAR/WASP cells restored the ability to generate blebs, allowing them to migrate. However the triple knockout cells still contain near-normal F-actin levels revealing that SCAR, WASP and dDia2 compete for actin [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29191847  (Davidson et al. 2017)]. <br />WASP both regulates, and is regulated by, activated Rac GTPases RacC ([/gene/DDB_G0293526 racC]) and Rac1A ([/gene/DDB_G0277869 rac1A]). WASP interacts with activated Rac via its CRIB motif, and this interaction is required for WASP to generate pseudopods in the absence of SCAR/WAVE. However this interaction also provides a means for WASP to remove activated Rac from the membrane via endocytosis. Thus WASP contributes to front-rear cell polarity by controlling localization and cellular levels of activated Rac.

G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs, rasGEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs, rasGAPs) inactivate Ras GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. RasG activation is reduced in ''gefR'' ([/gene/DDB_G0274605 gefR]) and ''gflB'' ([/gene/DDB_G0286773 gflB]) null mutant strains, indicating that these rasGEFs activate rasG. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17380187 Kae et al. 2007)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27009206 Senoo et al. 2016)]. In addition, rasGEF GefF ([/gene/DDB_G0293006 gefF]) is also reported to activate RasG ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967009 Williams et al. 2019)]. At least three RasGAPs inactivate ''rasG'': DdNF1 ([/gene/DDB_G0271750 nfaA]), C2GAP1 ([/gene/DDB_G0278483 ngap]) and IqgC ([/gene/DDB_G0288977 iqgC]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18948008 Zhang et al. 2008)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29109256 Xu et al. 2017)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30622175 Marinovic et al. 2019)]. ''rasG'' is expressed only during growth and early development, although a quantity of the RasG protein is present throughout development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2644652 Robbins et al. 1989]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2154684 Khosla et al. 1990]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10837033 Wilkins et al. 2000]). ''rasG'' is activated by cAMP, and this activation does not occur in a number of cAMP signaling mutants. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15143344 Kae et al. 2004)]. <br />RasG, either alone or in combination with other Ras proteins, is involved in mediating chemotaxis to cAMP, PI3K signaling, cytokinesis, and macropinocytosis. ''rasG'' null cells are multinucleate and display a wide range of defects in control of the actin cytoskeleton, including defective cell movement, loss of cell polarity, absence of normal lamellipodia, formation of unusual polymerized actin structures and abnormally long filopodia. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9245789 Tuxworth et al. 1997]). ''rasG'' null mutants display decreased PKB ([/gene/DDB_G0268620 pkbA]) activation, decreased cell polarity and decreased F-actin polymerization ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15534002 Sasaki et al. 2004)]. ''rasG'' null cells also have a defect in fluid uptake ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27960076 Veltman et al. 2016)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967009 Williams et al. 2019)]. Cells overexpressing an activated form of RasG fail to aggregate ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8754814 Khosla et al. 1996]). <br />RasG and RasC ([/gene/DDB_G0281385 rasC]) are critical mediators of the chemotactic response to cAMP with some overlap of function between the two genes. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16885420 Bolourani et al. 2006)]. RasG controls cAMP-mediated chemotaxis in part by regulating the activation of phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3Ks) and controlling the site of F-actin polymerization and the direction of migration. A feedback loop, mediated through localized F-actin polymerization, recruits cytosolic PI3K to the leading edge to amplify the chemotactic signal. RasG also regulates the plasma membrane recruitment and activation of downstream effectors including Akt/PKB. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16885420 Bolourani et al. 2006)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15534002 Sasaki et al. 2004)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18948008 Zhang et al. 2008)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29626371 Baumgardner et al. 2018)]. The RasGAPs ''nfaA'' and ''ngap'' act as regulators of RasG chemotactic signaling ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18948008 Zhang et al. 2008)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29109256 Xu et al. 2017)]. RasG and RasB ([/gene/DDB_G0292998 rasB]) regulate cytokinesis through the protein kinase NdrC ([/gene/DDB_G0284839 ndrC]). NdrC binds both RasG and RasB, and ''ndrC'' null cells display both a cytokinesis defect and increased levels of activated RasB and RasG. The multinucleate phenotype of ''rasG'' cells suggests a role for RasG in activating NdrC ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24986648 Mueller-Taubenberger et al. 2014)]. RasG and RasS ([/gene/DDB_G0283537 rasS]) are the most important Ras proteins involved in the regulation of macropinocytosis. The rasGEF GefF activates ''rasG'', and a ''gefF'' knock-in mutant also displays defects in fluid uptake, suggesting that it is involved in regulation of macropinocytosis through activation of ''rasG'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23843627 Hoeller et al. 2013)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27960076 Veltman et al. 2016)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967009 Williams et al. 2019)], while the RasGAP IqgC binds RasG and acts as a negative regulator of macropinocytosis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30622175 Marinovic et al. 2019)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 30-JAN-2020 RD; annotation contributions: PMID:24742374 Alex Chattwood

DDB_G0284183	Robert Dodson	MrfA is a transcription factor that regulates expression of the prestalk gene ([/gene/DDB_G0277853 ecmA]) in PstA cells [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22811266  (Senoo et al. 2012)]. MrfA was purified from slug stage nuclear extracts by affinity chromatography to a multimerized 39 bp CA-rich region from the ''ecmA'' promoter which is necessary and sufficient for expression of a reporter gene (''lacZ'') exclusively in anterior prestalk cells. The protein was found to be the product of a partially sequenced random cDNA [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8643615  (Kuspa and Loomis, 1996)]. The DNA binding region of MrfA is found in the middle of the 104 kDa protein and shows sequence similarity to the DNA binding region of human Myelin Regulatory Factor (MRF). There is a peptidase domain near the carboxy terminus followed by a transmembrane domain that is auto-catalytically cleaved releasing the 85 kDa fragment so that it can be localized within nuclei during development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24046445  (Senoo et al. 2013)]. Nuclear staining is lost from the prespore region when slugs are formed. Cells of ''mrfA'' null strains are delayed in culmination and fail to express the reporter gene linked to the multimerized 39 bp region from the proximal ''ecmA'' promoter [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22811266  (Senoo et al. 2012)]. Prespore and PstO cell specific gene expression are unaffected by the loss of MrfA.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 06-FEB-2018 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0288147	Robert Dodson	''pkcA'' encodes a protein kinase C ortholog that is expressed throughout development, but expression switches from pre stalk cells in the mound to prespore cells in slugs. ''pkcA'' null cells form multiple small mounds and display multiple cAMP wave generating centers. In addition, ''pkcA'' null cells have defects in chemotaxis and cell-cell adhesion. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26183108 Mohamed et al. 2015)]. ''pkcA'' regulates the initiation of development through the quorum sensing pathway, serving as a negative regulator of aggregation. ''pkcA'' and phospholipase D ([/gene/DDB_G0279483 pldB]) functionally interact to regulate a number of developmentally critical processes, such as adhesion, cell sorting and differentiation. PkcA positively regulates phospholipase D activity, suggesting that PkcA acts through regulating PldB ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28257811 Singh et al. 2017)]. ''pkcA'' is involved in the signal transduction pathway responsible for AprA-dependent ([/gene/DDB_G0281663 aprA]) chemorepulsion.

DDB_G0277399	Robert Dodson	Pianissimo, encoded by the ''piaA'' gene, was identified as a mutant unable to aggregate on bacterial lawns. PiaA is a 130-kD cytosolic protein required for chemotaxis and positive regulation of adenylate cyclase activity ([/gene/DDB_G0281545 acaA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9389653 Chen et al. 1997]).<br />The HSB1 mutant harbors a point mutation in the ''piaA'' gene, G917D, that causes a temperature-sensitive developmental phenotype: these cells can undergo aggregation and fruiting body formation at temperatures below 18 degrees C but not above. ''in vivo'' HSB1 mutants have defective G protein-linked adenylyl cyclase activation; transfection with the ''piaA'' but not [/gene/DDB_G0285161 dagA] gene rescues the mutant. PiaA is homogenously distributed in the cytoplasm, even after stimulation with chemoattractants ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12413895 Pergolizzi et al. 2002]).<br />Using Dictyostelium mutants to investigate the minimal requirements for chemotaxis, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22081140  Kortholt et al. 2011] identified a basal signaling module consisting of heterotrimeric and monomeric G proteins providing activation of Ras at the leading edge, which is sufficient for chemotaxis. The signalling enzymes PI3K, TorC2, PLA2 and sGC are not required for Ras activation and chemotaxis to folate or to steep gradients of cAMP; however they provide a memory of direction and improved orientation of the cell, which together increase the sensitivity about 150-fold for chemotaxis in shallow cAMP gradients.<br />PiaA is involved in the signal transduction pathway responsible for AprA-dependent ([/gene/DDB_G0281663 aprA]) chemorepulsion.

DDB_G0282813	Robert Dodson	''arcB'' encodes the 34 kDa subunit of the Arp2/3 complex [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11807934  (Insall et al. 2001)]. The seven subunits of this 200 kDa complex are encoded by ([/gene/DDB_G0277825 arcA]), ''arcB'', ([/gene/DDB_G0292804 arcC]), ([/gene/DDB_G0269102 arcD]), ([/gene/DDB_G0288319 arcE]), ([/gene/DDB_G0272106 arpB]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0283755 arpC]). The subunits of mammalian Arp2/3 are very similar to ''Dictyostelium'' homologs. Arp2/3 binds to the side of F-actin filaments and initiates polymerization of a new F-actin chain at an angle of 70 degrees leading to a branched actin network that can alter the shape of cells. The ability to nucleate new actin filaments is greatly stimulated by direct interactions with members of the WASP/SCAR family [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11807934  (Insall et al. 2001)]. The Arp2/3 complex largely mediates the actin polymerization response to chemotactic stimulation and contributes to cell motility, pseudopod extension and adhesion in Dictyostelium chemotaxis. The complete Arp2/3 complex is essential for growth; partial loss of activity of either ArcB or ArpB impairs growth and chemotaxis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17553489  (Langridge and Kay, 2007)]. mRNA from each of the genes encoding Arp2/3 subunits accumulates coordinately to reach a peak at 3 hours of development and gradually decreases thereafter [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. The Arp2/3 complex interacts with the protein CARMIL, which serves as a scaffold for the assembly of a larger complex of proteins involved in the nucleation and termination of actin filament assembly. The complex consists of CARMIL ([/gene/DDB_G0292386 carmil]), AcpA, ([/gene/DDB_G0267374 acpA]) AcpB, ([/gene/DDB_G0272104 acpB]) the Arp2/3 complex, and type I myosins MyoB ([/gene/DDB_G0289117 myoB]) and MyoC ([/gene/DDB_G0276617 myoC]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11425877  (Jung et al. 2001)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 23-MAY-2019 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0277075	Robert Dodson	''detA'' encodes the homolog of the human DET1 component of E3 ubiquitin ligase that, along with F-box/WD40-repeat-containing proteins, mediate the ubiquitination of proteins to target them for degradation by the proteasome (ubiquitin-protein ligase activity). DetA is found localized to the nucleus, and a plant homolog of DET1 has been shown to bind to the N-terminal tail of histone H2B. The ''Dictyostelium'' ''detA'' gene was disrupted by targeted homologous recombination and the mutation was shown to have rather mild effects on growth and development. The doubling time was extended from 10 hrs to 12 hrs and there was some increase in the proportion of slug cells expressing the prestalk marker ecmAO: GFP. DetA is involved in cell type specification during development, and possibly is responsible for the degradation of a repressor of prestalk genes, although further evidence would be necessary for this conclusion ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21193547 Dubin et al. 2010)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 06-MAR-2019 RD
DDB_G0274575	Robert Dodson	Besides ''mhcA'' ([/gene/DDB_G0286355 mhcA]) that encodes the classical myosin heavy chain, ''Dictyostelium'' carries genes for 12 unconventional myosins. The first 5 unconventional myosins ([/gene/DDB_G0280039 myoA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0289117 myoB]), ([/gene/DDB_G0276617 myoC]), ([/gene/DDB_G0275447 myoD]), ([/gene/DDB_G0288679 myoE]), were isolated from whole genome plasmid clones by low stringency probing with portions of the head region of ''mhcA''. The next 6 unconventional myosins ([/gene/DDB_G0289177 myoF]), ([/gene/DDB_G0276363 myoG]), ([/gene/DDB_G0289447 myoH]), ([/gene/DDB_G0274455 myoI]), ([/gene/DDB_G0272112 myoJ]) and ''myoK'' were recognized in large YAC clones that represent the whole genome [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7937787  (Titus et al. 1994)]. ''myoK'' encodes myosin 1K which has a myosin motor domain at the N-terminus and almost no tail region [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10403059  (Schwarz et al. 1999)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10049776  (Yazu et al. 1999)]. Cells lacking MyoK showed excessive ruffling of large lamellipodia, accompanied by a thicker basal actin cortex and reduced motility [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10652255  (Schwarz et al. 2000)]. MyoK is enriched at actin-dense constriction furrow at the neck of phagosome where it binds the actin-binding protein AbpE ([/gene/DDB_G0273447 abpE-1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0273517 abpE-2]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22736568  (Dieckmann et al. 2012)]. The protein kinase PakB ([/gene/DDB_G0276459 pakB]) phosphorylates MyoK and positively regulates phagocytosis while Abp1 (AbpE) negatively regulates PakB and MyoK. Null mutations in ''myoK'' reduce the efficiency of phagocytosis and slow down phagosome acidification by the vacuolar proton pump [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20200225  (Dieckmann et al. 2010)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22736568  (Dieckmann et al. 2012)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 12-SEP-2019 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0277155	Robert Dodson	Following the endosymbiosis of bacteria to create mitochondria, eukaryotes adapted to translation of mitochondrial proteins in the cytoplasm by synthesizing translocase proteins. This group of proteins form the mitochondrial outer membrane translocase (TOM) complex and function to import nuclear-encoded gene products into the mitochondria. Two components of this complex were identified in ''Dictyostelium'': a major channel protein, [/gene/DDB_G0277155 tom40], contains a putative transmembrane beta-barrel, and associates with [/gene/DDB_G0282897 tom7] in other species.

DDB_G0283005	Petra Fey	AgtA is a ''Dictyostelium'' galactosyltransferase involved in modifying Skp1 ([/gene/DDB_G0269230 fpaA] and [/gene/DDB_G0273251 fpaB-1]/[/gene/DDB_G0273615 fpaB-2] genes), which is part of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex. The initial step in Skp1 glycosylation involves the hydroxylation of Pro143 by a proline hydroxylase ([/gene/DDB_G0277759 phyA], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9660787 Teng-umnuay et al. 1998]). HyPro143 is then modified by the glycosyltransferase [/gene/DDB_G0275699 gnt1], which transfers a GlcNAc (N-acetylglucosamine) to the Skp1 protein ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10593934 Teng-umnuay et al. 1999]). The Skp1-GlcNAc is extended by a bifunctional diglycosyltransferase, [/gene/DDB_G0283761 pgtA], which processively adds galactose and fucose ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11423539 van der Wel et al. 2001], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12244067 van der Wel et al. 2002]). Subsequently two additional galactose residues are added by [/gene/DDB_G0283005 agtA] to yield the Skp1 pentasaccharide (GGFGGnOSkp1). Also, Skp1 is the only substrate of AgtA ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16495217 Ercan et al. 2006], reviewed in [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128470 West and Kim 2019]).<br />SKP1 glycosylation is required for optimal oxygen sensing during development. West and colleagues reported that the proline hydroxylase ([/gene/DDB_G0277759 phyA]) performing the first SKP1 modification mediates oxygen signaling during ''Dictyostelium'' development. ''phyA''-null cells need strongly elevated oxygen levels to culminate ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17699611 West et al. 2007]). Furthermore, ''agtA'' knockout and overexpression mutants were shown to require elevated oxygen levels to culminate. In addition the high oxygen requirement of ''agtA'' null cells is ameliorated by reduction of Skp1 levels ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19687007 Wang et al. 2009], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22128189 Zhang et al. 2011], reviewed in [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25988702 West and Blader 2015]). AgtA contains a C-terminal WD40 repeat domain in addition to its single catalytic domain that confers a salt-sensitive second-site binding interaction with Skp1. AgtA binds similarly well to precursor forms of Skp1, which competes with Skp1-F-box protein binding. When AgtA glycosylates Skp1,WD-40 domain binding is diminished. These results and mutant analyses suggest that AgtA mediates non-enzymatic control of unmodified and substrate precursor forms of Skp1. This binding mechanism is then relieved by switch-like activation of its glycosylation function This attests to a complex regulation of SKP1 modification and function ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24550398 Shafer et al. 2014]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 09-MAR-2020 PF

DDB_G0289145	Robert Dodson	Pde7 has a signal sequence at the N-terminus for secretion across membranes followed by a catalytic domain very similar to that of the major extracellular cAMP phosphodiesterase PdsA ([/gene/DDB_G0285995 pdsA]), and is responsible for residual cAMP phosphodiestedrase activity on the surface of cells that lack PdsA. Pde7, like PdsA, is a dual specificity phosphodiesterase which hydrolyzes both cAMP and cGMP [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17040207  (Bader et al. 2007)]. '' pde7'' lies three genes downstream of ''pde4'' ([/gene/DDB_G0289121 pde4]) on chromosome 5 and, like ''pde4'', is expressed only between 6 and 16 hours of development. Both ''pde4'' and ''pde7'' encode secreted phosphodiesterases with similar affinities to cAMP but Pde7 accounts for less than 3% of the activity during slug stages [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17040207  (Bader et al. 2007)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 15-NOV-2018 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0281889	Robert Dodson	As in many other species, Dictyostelium has two alpha-tubulin genes ([/gene/DDB_G0287689 tubA]) and tubA2. The sequences of these genes are 65% identical, however, the abundance of tubA2 mRNA is less than 10% that of tubA mRNA during growth or development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. It is not clear what specialized physiological role TubA2 might play.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 06-NOV-2017 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0287687	Robert Dodson	A family of nearly identical small proteins, GerA, GerB, and GerC, ([/gene/DDB_G0287293 gerA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0287583 gerC]) are coordinately synthesized during late culmination and again following the initiation of germination of spores [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2926809  (Giorda et al. 1989)]. Each of the proteins is 127 amino acids long and has a cannonical signal sequence at the N-terminus that could direct co-translational transport across membranes. No conserved domains are present that could give an indication of possible functions. The nucleotide sequences of the respective genes, ''gerA'', ''gerB'', and ''gerC'', are all very similar and are free of introns. These genes may result from recent duplications.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 10-OCT-2018 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0290157	Robert Dodson	The sequence and structure of the protein encoded by ''pkgB'', PkbR1, is closely related to that of PKB ([/gene/DDB_G0268620 pkbA]), and these protein kinases have partially overlapping functions during aggregation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10873800 Meili et al. 2000)]. mRNA from ''pkgB'' starts to accumulates only after several hours of development while mRNA from ''pkbA'' is present in growing cells and decreases during early development. Unlike PKB, PkbR1 does not have a PH-domain but, as the result of N-terminal myristoylation, is permanently tethered to membranes where it can be activated in response to cAMP binding to the G protein coupled receptor, Car1 ([/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1], [/gene/DDB_G0273533 carA-2]). Stimulation of the RasC-GEF, AleA ([/gene/DDB_G0284329 gefA]), by Gbeta/gamma ([/gene/DDB_G0277143 gpbA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0274125 gpgA]), leads to RasC-GTP ([/gene/DDB_G0281385 rasC]), which activates the protein kinase complex TORC2 ([/gene/DDB_G0281569 tor]). Both PkbR1 and PKB are phosphorylated by TORC2 in a hydrophobic motif and activated when PDK1 ([/gene/DDB_G0281471 pdkA]) phosphorylates the activation loop ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16079174 Lee et al. 2005)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18635356 Kamimura et al. 2008)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20200230 Kimmel et al. 2010)].<br />The adaptor protein, Daydreamer (dydA), ([/gene/DDB_G0287875 dydA]) is responsible for deactivating PkbR1 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23135995 Kolsch et al. 2013)]. One of the substrates of PkbR1 is the phosphoinositol 5-kinase, PikI ([/gene/DDB_G0267588 pikI]) which generates PI(4,5)P2 from PI(4)P. Activation of PikI by PkbR1 initiates a positive feedback loop in which PI(4,5)P2 plays an essential role in further activation of PkbR1 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24485835 Fets et al. 2014)]. PKB functions predominantly during aggregation to control cell polarity, whereas PKBR-1 is required for morphogenesis during multicellular development. ''pkgB'' null mutants arrest at the mound stage but this block can be suppressed by over expression of PKB ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10873800 Meili et al. 2000)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21335531 Ochiai et al. 2011)]. PkbR1 plays a role in the signal transduction pathway by which GABA induces release of the SDF-2 precursor AcbA ([/gene/DDB_G0270658 acbA]) during culmination ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16672332  Anjard and Loomis, 2006)]. Fluid uptake is almost abolished in ''pkbA'' ([/gene/DDB_G0268620 pkbA]) ''pkgB'' double mutants due to the signifcantly reduced size of macropinosomes in these mutant cells.

DDB_G0284611	Robert Dodson	RipA is a component of the TORC2 complex, which consists of ([/gene/DDB_G0281569 tor]), ([/gene/DDB_G0292592 lst8]), ([/gene/DDB_G0277399 piaA]) and ''ripA''. The TORC2 complex plays a central and critical role in chemotaxis and relay of the cAMP signal [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10473630  (Lee et al. 1999)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16079174  (Lee et al. 2005)]. RipA was isolated as a Ras-interacting protein and later found to be orthologous to the SinA component of human TORC2. Activated RasC ([/gene/DDB_G0281385 rasC]) stimulates TORC2 to phosphorylate downstream protein kinases, PKB ([/gene/DDB_G0268620 pkbA]) and PKBR1 ([/gene/DDB_G0290157 pkgB]), as well as to activate adenylyl cyclase ([/gene/DDB_G0281545 acaA]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18635356  (Kamimura et al. 2008)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20660630  (Cai et al. 2010)]. The small GTPase RapA ([/gene/DDB_G0291237 rapA]) binds to RipA, and also regulates TORC2 activity along with RasC [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27172998  (Khanna et al. 2016)]. ''ripA'' null cells are unable to aggregate or polarize in a cAMP gradient but express early developmental genes in response to cAMP pulses [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10473630  (Lee et al. 1999)]. Treating ''ripA'' null cells with artificial pulses of cAMP rescues development, indicating that ligand binding to CAR1 ([/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0273533 carA-2]) can stimulate TOR activity in the absence of RipA [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10473630  (Lee et al. 1999)]. Cells lacking ''ripA'', ''piaA'' and ''lst8'' have significantly elevated rates of phagocytosis, revealing that the TORC2 complex is also a negative regulator of phagocytosis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22266904  (Rosel et al. 2012)].

DDB_G0275447	Robert Dodson	Besides ''mhcA'' ([/gene/DDB_G0286355 mhcA]) that encodes the classical myosin heavy chain, Dictyostelium carries genes for 12 unconventional myosins. ''myoD'' encodes myosin ID which has an N-terminal motor domain with an actin-activated ATPase and a carboxy terminal domain that is rich in glycine, proline and alanine and can bind actin [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8325874  (Jung et al. 1993)]. MyoD associates with a 16 kDa light chain encoded by ''mlcD'' ([/gene/DDB_G0277917 mlcD]) that has about 48% sequence identity with calmodulin ([/gene/DDB_G0279407 calA]) but has a low affinity for calcium. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12826013  (De La Roche et al. 2003)] ''myoD'' mRNA is abundant during the first two hours of development, decreases to a minimum at T=7 hrs and then reaccumulates to a peak at T=11 hrs. ''mlcD'' is coordinately expressed with ''myoD'' [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)].<br />The tail homology (TH1) domain of MyoD binds to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) which accumulates at the front of cells where the PI3kinases are active and PTEN ([/gene/DDB_G0286557 pten]) is excluded [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22296834  (Chen et al. 2012)]. Although MyoD is found localized to pseudopods at the leading edge of migating cells, cells lacking MyoD showed no obvious growth or developmental defects [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8325874  (Jung et al. 1993)]. However, triple null mutant cells lacking ''myoD'', ''myoE'' ([/gene/DDB_G0288679 myoE]) and ''myoF'' ([/gene/DDB_G0289177 myoF]) are defective in chemotaxis to cAMP, chemoattractant-stimulated actin polymerization and phagocytosis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22296834  (Chen et al. 2012)]. The amino acid sequences of MyoD, MyoE, and MyoF are more similar to each other than to other myosins; together they form a group of unconventional myosins involved in growth and development.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 26-AUG-2019 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

DDB_G0276883	Robert Dodson	The catalytic subunit of calcineurin is encoded by ''canA''. The primary sequence of this calcium/calmodulin dependent protein phosphatase is very similar to the sequences of calcineurin A in mammals [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8735922  (Malchow et al. 1996)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8681950  (Dammann et al. 1996)]. In the absence of calcium, calcineurin A forms inactive heterodimers with the regulatory subunit calcineurin B ([/gene/DDB_G0267446 cnbA]) that are converted to active heterotetramers when they bind Ca++/calmodulin [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25518940  (Sugden et al. 2014)]. RNA-seq studies have shown that canA and cnbA are coordinately expressed during early aggregation and reach a peak at 11 hrs of development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. Inhibition of the enzyme activity by cyclosporin A has little effect on growth or aggregation but results in reduced expression of prestalk and prespore specific genes [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8855370  (Horn and Gross, 1996)]. Inhibition of calcineurin activity with the polyphenolic aldehyde, gossypol, reduces the rate of growth and the number of aggregates formed after 24 hrs of development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15621416  (Weissenmayer et al. 2005)]. cAMP relay is inhibited within 10 minutes of addition of 10 microM gossypol. Gossypol also stimulates nuclear translocation of the prestalk transcription factor DimB ([/gene/DDB_G0291372 dimB]) within a few minutes and blocks nuclear translocation of the transcription factor TacA ([/gene/DDB_G0291342 tacA]) in response to calcium indicating that calcineurin mediates these responses [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22944283  (Thewes et al. 2012)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25518940  (Sugden et al. 2014)]. Cells lacking calcineurin as the result of expression of RNAi for either ''canA'' or ''cnbA'' form a reduced number of fruiting bodies with short stalks [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16512895  (Boeckeler et al. 2006)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23686520  (Thewes et al. 2013)]. These mutant strains are also hypersensitive to high levels of cations showing that calcineurin is responsible for stress responses as in other organisms.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 22-MAR-2018 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis; annotation contributions PMID:23686520 Sascha Thewes
DDB_G0268038	Robert Dodson	The Mtpn (V-1) protein binds to and regulates the heterodimeric F-actin capping protein complex (CP) ([/gene/DDB_G0267374 acpA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0272104 acpB]). Mtpn binding blocks CP from capping the barbed end of actin filaments thereby increasing cellular F-actin content. Cells lacking ''mtpn'' exhibit reduced F-actin levels and contain significant defects in cellular processes dependent on actin assembly, including macropinocytosis in vegetative cells, and chemotactic aggregation, cell motility, cell polarity and adhesion in starved cells. In addition, evidence suggests that the ability of Mtpn to bind and sequester CP is regulated by phosphorylation of Mtpn.

DDB_G0273443	Robert Dodson	''atg4'' was isolated together with several other members of the autophagy family of genes, conserved from yeast to man ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12626495 Otto et al. 2003)]. Macroautophagy is used to recycle cellular components during starvation and development. The hallmark of the mechanism is the formation of a cytosolic double membrane vesicle that engulfs parts of the cytoplasm, protein aggregates, and abnormal organelles. These vesicles fuse with lysosomes where the cargo is degraded. ATG4 is an ortholog of the conserved cysteine protease that processes the ubiquitin-like protein ATG8 ([/gene/DDB_G0286191 atg8a]) to uncover a conserved glycine at the C terminus that can covalently bind to membrane phospholipid with the aid of the E1-type enzyme ATG7 ([/gene/DDB_G0271096 atg7]) and the E2-type enzyme ATG3 ([/gene/DDB_G0277319 atg3]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20603609 Calvo-Garrido et al. 2010)].

DDB_G0290963	Robert Dodson	''kif1'' encodes a large, 248 kDa kinesin that functions as the major molecular motor for transport of organelles to the plus-ends of microtubules [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10545495  (Pollock et al. 1999)]. Kif1 has an N-terminal motor domain highly similar to human kinesin KIF1B and ''Caenorhabditis elegans'' ''unc104'' motor domain that is followed by a Forkhead-associated domain that can bind phosphoproteins, and a Pleckstrin homology domain that can bind membrane-associated phosphatidylinositol (4,5) bisphosphate (PIP2). In ''Dictyostelium'', Kif1 functions as a dimer and appears to cluster in PIP2 containing rafts [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12015984  (Klopfenstein et al. 2002)]. Kinesins move along microtubules by a "hand-over-hand" mechanism in which they tilt over to allow the motor domains to step past one another using the energy of ATP hydrolysis. Endosomes are transported along microtubules with frequent reversals in direction due to a tug-of-war between kinesin (kif1) pulling to the plus-end and dynein ([/gene/DDB_G0276355 dhcA]) pulling to the minus-end [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19864630  (Soppina et al. 2009)]. A knockout of ''kif1'' results in a 60% decrease in organelle transport, but the cells can still grow [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10545495  (Pollock et al. 1999)].

DDB_G0281555	Robert Dodson	The motor domain and microtubule binding sites in the kinesin encoded by ''kif7'' are at the N-terminus as is seen in other members of the kinesin KHC subfamily that includes products of the Dictyostelium genes [/gene/DDB_G0280967 kif3] and [/gene/DDB_G0276369 kif5] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9693369  (de Hostos et al. 1998)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14641909  (Kollmar and Glockner 2003)]. These conventional kinesins are involved in transport of diverse organelles to the plus ends of microtubules. Kif7 is localized around nuclei but can be easily washed off following cell lysis. Cells lacking Kif7 because of a mutation in ''kif7'' grow and develop normally suggesting that this kinesin is dispensible for common functions.

DDB_G0270122	Robert Dodson	''rasW'' encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Ras family of small GTPases. G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs, rasGEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs, rasGAPs) inactivate Ras GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. An analysis of ''Dictyostelium'' ras family genes reveals that ''rasU'' ([/gene/DDB_G0270138 rasU]), ''rasV'' ([/gene/DDB_G0270736 rasV]), ''rasW'', ''rasX'' ([/gene/DDB_G0270124 rasX]), ''rasY'' ([/gene/DDB_G0270126 rasY]) and ''rasZ'' ([/gene/DDB_G0270140 rasZ]) form a separate phylogenetic clade ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29614268 Park et al. 2018]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 24-MAR-2020 RD
DDB_G0274597	Petra Fey	Developing ''Dictyostelium'' cells aggregate to form fruiting bodies. The group size of aggregates is largely regulated by a secreted complex of 4 polypeptides called counting factor (CF). CF is composed of countin (encoded by the [/gene/DDB_G0274597 ctnA] gene), [/gene/DDB_G0273175 cf50-1], [/gene/DDB_G0269248 cf45-1] and [/gene/DDB_G0284363 cf60]. In transformants with a disrupted ''ctnA'' gene, aggregation streams do not break up, resulting in large fruiting bodies ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10444594 Brock and Gomer 1999]). The presence of caffeine rescued the ''ctnA'' null increased aggregate size phenotype and induced formation of smaller aggregates ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22269093 Jaiswal et al. 2012)]. CF regulates group size by negative regulation of cell adhesion ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11090633 Roisin-Bouffay et al. 2001]), cell motility ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11818526 Tang et al. 2002]), down-regulating the cAMP-induced cGMP pulse through inhibition of guanylyl cyclase activity, and decreasing the cAMP-stimulated cAMP pulse ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11371560 Tang et al. 2001]). In contrast, recombinant countin potentiates the cAMP pulse ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14557265 Brock et al. 2003]). The presence of countin enhances the cAMP-stimulated transient translocation of [/gene/DDB_G0268620 pkbA] and [/gene/DDB_G0285161 dagA] from the cytosol to membranes ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15470246 Gao et al. 2004]).<br />CF increases actin filament polymerization and myosin phosphorylation and redistribution ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11818526 Tang et al. 2002]). The specific roles of countin have been investigated by comparing the effect of addition of recombinant countin to cells compared to addition of semi-purified CF. The responses to recombinant countin and CF are similar with respect to cAMP signal transduction, and cell motility. However, countin does not decrease cell-cell adhesion or group size to the extent that semi-purified CF does ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12070154 Gao et al. 2002]). Cells lacking bioactive CF have high glucose levels, whereas transformants over-secreting CF have low glucose levels. Adding exogenous glucose negates the effect of high levels of extracellular CF on group size and mimics the effect of depleting CF on glucose levels, cell-cell adhesion, cAMP pulse size, actin polymerization, myosin assembly, and motility. These results suggest that glucose is a downstream component in part of the CF signaling pathway ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12161440 Jang et al. 2002]). In support, it has been shown that CF decreases the activity of the gluconeogenic enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15643062 Jang and Gomer 2005]). <br />Countin represents a new family within the amoebapore superfamily of proteins based on the presence of three predicted disulfide bridges and a tertiary structure similar to that of other members of the superfamily. Amoebapore superfamily proteins bind membranes and are extremely stable ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10998571 Zhai and Saier 2000]). CF is over-secreted in [/gene/DDB_G0287587 smlA] mutants ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10444594 Brock and Gomer 1999]). Secreted countin appears to be protected from degradation by CF50 [/gene/DDB_G0273175 cf50-1] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12117815 Brock et al.2002]). The eIF2alpha kinase [/gene/DDB_G0272837 ifkA] can stabilize and enhance the translational efficiency of countin mRNA ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12697064 Fang et al.2003]).

DDB_G0276027	Robert Dodson	''pdeE'' encodes a cAMP-stimulated cAMP phosphodiesterase which participates along with RegA ([/gene/DDB_G0284331 regA]) in breaking down intracellular cAMP. The affinity of PdeE for cAMP is much lower than the affintity of RegA for cAMP [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17040207  (Bader et al. 2007)]. PdeE has a beta-lactamase catalytic site followed by two cNMP binding sites, the same order of domains found in the highly related cGMP-activated cGMP phosphodiesterase PdeD ([/gene/DDB_G0274383 pdeD]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12429832  (Bosgraaf et al. 2002)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12574165  (Meima et al. 2003)]. cGMP is also hydrolyzed by PdeE but much more slowly than cAMP. '' pdeE'' is expressed between 6 and 16 hours of development when it could regulate PKA ([/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC], [/gene/DDB_G0279413 pkaR]) activity affecting post-aggregation differentiation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. ''pdeE'' knock-out strains have high levels of cAMP and are sporogenous much like ''regA'' nulls.

''racH'' mRNA is expressed as two transcripts, both of which are undetectable at the vegetative stage, but expression increases at the onset of development. ''racH'' expression reaches a maxium level during the aggregation stage followed by continued, but decreased expression during later stages of development. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11201251 Okuwa et al. 2001]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11222756 Rivero et al. 2001]). RacH localizes predominantly to membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus and nuclear envelope. ''racH'' null mutants have defects in pinocytosis, exocytosis, the acidification of early endosomes and the secretion of acid phosphatase from the lysosome. In addition, the distribution of the post-lysosomal marker vacuolin ([/gene/DDB_G0289485 vacA]) is altered in ''racH'' null mutants, but growth, cytokinesis, cell motility and chemotaxis are normal. In a cell-free system, RacH stimulates actin polymerization, suggesting that RacH is involved in actin-based trafficking of vesicular compartments ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17004322 Somesh et al. 2006]). ''racH'' also plays a role in host-pathogen interactions. ''racH'' null mutant cells are more susceptible to infection by ''Mycobacterium marinum'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17587329 Hagedorn et al. 2007]) and ''Legionella pneumophila'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21655438 Balest et al. 2011]). RacH is also involved in the release of bacteria from the infected cell. ''racH'' mutant cells are deficient in intercellular spreading of mycobacteria and lack an F-actin based structure termed the ejectosome that is responsible for the nonlytic release of cytosolic mycobacteria ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19325115 Hagedorn et al. 2009]). ''atg1'' ([/gene/DDB_G0292390 atg1]) null mutants are also defective in intercellular transmission of mycobacteria, indicating that a functioning autophagy pathway is required for the ejection of mycobacterium from ''Dictyostelium discoideum'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25646440 Gerstenmaier et al. 2015]). ''Yersinia pestis'' YopE blocks the effects of overexpressing RacH, suggesting that RacH could be a target of YopE ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19602247 Vlahou et al. 2009]).

Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rab GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Rab GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. Rab2A is highly similar to human RAB2B. Rab2A is associated with both the Golgi membrane and the contractile vacuole system [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27240981  (Maringer et al. 2016)]. In addition, proteomic analysis revealed that Rab2A is localized to lipid droplets ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24036346 Du, et al. 2013]) and also to the Legionella-containing vacuole [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28183814  (Schmolders et al. 2017)]. <br />''rab2A'' is involved in signaling networks that regulate vesicle trafficking, contractile vacuole function and response to osmotic stress. Rab2A over-expressing cells and dominant-negative (DN) Rab2A cells display a significant decrease in the rate of phagocytosis, while the rate of phagocytosis is significantly increased in constitutively active (CA) Rab2A cells. Both CA and DN Rab2A mutants also had defects in development, growth, and cell-cell adhesion [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25157910  (Maringer et al. 2014)]. Both Rab2A and Rab GTPase RabS ([/gene/DDB_G0282537 rabS]) localize to both the Golgi membrane and the contractile vacuole system. ''rab2A'' and ''rabS'' over-expressing and mutant cell lines show defects in osmoregulation under osmotically stressed conditions, indicating that both genes are involved in the regulation of the response to osmotic stress. In both Rab2 overexpressing cells and CA Rab2 mutant cells in hypo-osmotic conditions, the contractile vacuoles appeared to have fused into one large contractile vacuole, indicating that these cells were not able to expel water and these cells eventually lysed. DN Rab2 mutant cells were swollen and lacked contractile vacuoles [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27240981  (Maringer et al. 2016)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 22-SEP-2020 RD

Additional findings indicate that BzpR regulates aspects of development in Dictyostelium, serving as a downstream effector of eIF2a phosphorylation. BzpR production is translationally regulated during development by eIF2alpha phosphorylation by IfkA and IfkB, and through the use of upstream ORFs within the bzpR 5' UTR.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 02-Nov-2017 RD

DDB_G0284293	Petra Fey	The homeodomain is a sequence-specific DNA binding motif that consists of a helix-turn-helix. Homeobox-containing proteins have transcription factor activity. They have beenidentified in most if not all phyla of eukaryotes. Inmetazoans, homeobox-containing proteins are known to be involvedin regulating the anterior-posterior body plan and in thespecification of certain cell types and anterior-posteriorcompartments (see [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9486804 Han and Firtel 1998] and references therein). There are 14 predicted proteins that contain homeobox domains in ''Dictyostelium'':[/gene/DDB_G0275173 hbx2], [/gene/DDB_G0291075 warA], [/gene/DDB_G0291197 hbx3], [/gene/DDB_G0272967 hbx4], [/gene/DDB_G0273127 hbx5-1] (on the chromosome 2 duplication: [/gene/DDB_G0273645 hbx5-2]), [/gene/DDB_G0277505 hbx6], [/gene/DDB_G0278225 hbx7], [/gene/DDB_G0279257 hbx8], [/gene/DDB_G0280473 hbx9], [/gene/DDB_G0284293 hbx10], [/gene/DDB_G0295787 hbx11], [/gene/DDB_G0286733 hbx12], [/gene/DDB_G0288975 hbx13], and [/gene/DDB_G0289677 hbx14].<br />[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25963254 Mishra and Saran 2015] performed a genome-wide classification and comparative genomic analysis of the 14 homeobox genes present in D. discoideum, and found that they could be classified into 3 groups: TALE, OTHER and NOVEL classes, ''hbx10'' belonging to the OTHER class.<br />A peptide with cell penetrating abilities has been isolated, which is 16 amino acids long and contained in the Hbx10 protein, residues 343 to 358. The peptide, its kind often called penetratin, has been named Cupid. A Cupid-GFP fusion protein has been tested on mammalian, whole plant cells, plant leaf protoplast and fungal cell cultures. When observed using confocal microscopy, GFP fluorescence has been detected within the cell cytosol in 60 minutes, demonstrating Cupid-GFP has permeated the cells and folded correctly. These data suggest that Cupid can act as a molecular vehicle, delivering proteins, such as GFP, into the cytosol of a variety of cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32792509  Fenton et al. 2020]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 24-AUG-2020 PF
DDB_G0270140	Robert Dodson	''rasZ'' encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Ras family of small GTPases. G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs, rasGEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs, rasGAPs) inactivate Ras GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. An analysis of ''Dictyostelium'' ras family genes reveals that ''rasU'' ([/gene/DDB_G0270138 rasU]), ''rasV'' ([/gene/DDB_G0270736 rasV]), ''rasW'' ([/gene/DDB_G0270122 rasW]), ''rasX'' ([/gene/DDB_G0270124 rasX]), ''rasY'' ([/gene/DDB_G0270126 rasY]) and ''rasZ'' form a separate phylogenetic clade ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29614268 Park et al. 2018]).

DDB_G0272324	Robert Dodson	Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is characterized by exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, bone marrow failure and skeletal abnormalities, and is caused by mutations in the highly conserved SBDS gene. ''Dictyostelium'' ''sbds'' encodes the ortholog of human SBDS with which it exhibits an overall identity of 38% and similarity of 69%. Attempts to create null mutants of ''sbds'' were unsuccessful, but conditional mutants using temperature-sensitive self-splicing inteins were engineered and introduced into the ''sbds'' gene to assess its function. In ''sbds'' conditional mutants, growth is abolished at the restrictive temperature and development arrests at the loose mound stage. In addition, the mutants have increased levels of free 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits and decreased levels of mature 80S ribosomes, indicating that SbdS has a conserved function in ribosomal subunit joining. These phenotypes can all be complemented by expression of human SBDS. Overexpression of ''eIF6'' ([/gene/DDB_G0276493 eIF6]) also impairs ribosomal subunit joining. eIF6 binds pre-60S subunits in the nucleus and is exported with them into the cytoplasm. The ribosomal subunit joining defect in ''sbds'' mutants, as well as their growth and developmental phenotypes, can also be suppressed by expressing a mutant form of eIF6 with reduced affinity for 60S ribosomal subunits. SBDS and Elongation factor-like GTPase EFL1 ([/gene/DDB_G0279689 eftud1]) interact directly ''in vivo'' and are bound in close physical proximity on the surface of the 60S ribosomal subunit, where they activate nascent 60S ribosomal subunits for translation by catalyzing eviction of the anti-association factor eIF6 from nascent 60S ribosomal subunits. These findings support the hypothesis that SDS is a ribosomopathy caused by impaired release of eIF6 and defective ribosomal subunit joining due to mutations in the ribosome assembly factor SBDS [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21803848  (Wong et al. 2011)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26479198  (Weis et al. 2015)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 15-OCT-2020 RD
DDB_G0270658	Robert Dodson	Acyl-CoA Binding protein is a small, highly conserved facilitator of intracellular lipid trafficking that is encoded by ''acbA''. It is also the precursor of an intercellular peptide signal that is referred to as DBI (Diazepam Binding Inhibitor) in humans and SDF-2 (spore differentiation factor) in ''Dictyostelium'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15897458 Anjard and Loomis, 2005)]. SDF-2 binds to the receptor histidine kinase DhkA ([/gene/DDB_G0280961 dhkA]) and converts it to a protein phosphatase. During culmination, GABA secreted by prespore cells triggers release of AcbA from other prespore cells. The protein has to diffuse to prestalk cells near the top of the rising stalk to be processed by the extracellular protease TagC ([/gene/DDB_G0286121 tagC]) and generate the 34 amino acid peptide that is SDF-2 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9473320 Anjard et al. 1998)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15897458 Anjard and Loomis, 2005)]. When SDF-2 binds DhkA on prespore cells, the response regulator region of the cAMP phosphodiesterase RegA ([/gene/DDB_G0284331 regA]) is dephosphorylated leading to reduced enzymatic activity. The resulting accumulation of cAMP stimulates PKA ([/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC], [/gene/DDB_G0279413 pkaR]) activity leading to rapid sporulation. The SDF-2 cascade is initiated by a steroid binding to the G protein-coupled-receptor GrlA ([/gene/DDB_G0271684 grlA]) that signals GABA release and AcbA secretion and processing ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19176583 Anjard et al. 2009)]. AcbA lacks the N-terminal signal sequence necessary for classical secretion and is dependent on the membrane-associated protein GRASP ([/gene/DDB_G0293248 grpA]) for unconventional secretion ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17655921 Kinseth et al. 2007)]. Autophagy is involved in the unconventional secretion of AcbA in the pathway leading to SDF-2 signaling. AcbA is found in vesicles just beneath the plasma membrane until it is released to the intercellular space in response to GABA ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20472692 Cabral et al. 2010)].

DDB_G0280983	Robert Dodson	In a search for novel receptors similar to the cAR (cAMP receptor) proteins [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14732403 Raisley et al. (2004)] identified three crl (cAMP receptor-like) genes: ''crlA'', [/gene/DDB_G0289395 crlB], and [/gene/DDB_G0283619 crlC]. All three of the Crl proteins are predicted to contain a seven transmembrane domain characteristic of G-protein coupled receptors. The ''crlA'' transcript is expressed at low levels throughout growth and development, whereas the ''crlB'' and ''crlC'' transcripts are developmentally regulated. A ''crlA-'' mutant developed in the KAX3 background has an increased growth rate, implying a role for ''crlA'' in negative regulation of growth. The ''crlA-'' mutant also exhibits a delayed tip formation phenotype. ''crlA'' overexpression fails to rescue the [/gene/DDB_G0283605 yakA] null mutant phenotype, which is similar to that of ''crlA-''. Additionally, chimeric aggregates with a 1:20 ratio of GFP labeled ''crlA-'' cells to wild-type cells show that ''crlA-'' cells preferentially sort to the prespore region [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14732403 (Raisley et al. 2004)].<br />The ''crlA-''/KAX3 mutant is deficient in spore formation and is insensitive to the polyketide MPBD (4-methyl-5-pentylbenzene-1,3-diol) a component of the SDF-1 (spore differentiation factor-1) signalling cascade, suggesting that CrlA is the MPBD receptor [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21602484 (Anjard et al. 2011)]. However, a ''crlA-'' mutant developed in the AX2 background displays none of the phenotypes associated with the ''crlA-''/KAX3 mutant, demonstrating that CrlA does not act as the sole receptor for MPBD in Ax2 cells [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28158557 (Narita et al. 2017)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 13-FEB-2017 RD

DDB_G0269364	Robert Dodson	''stlA'' null strains have aberrant, glassy sori with most cells failing to form a cell wall. ''stlA'' mutants also do not produce the differentiation-inducing factor 4-methyl-5-pentylbenzene-1,3-diol (MPBD) that is responsible for the induction of spore maturation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21438914  (Narita et al. 2011)]. Additional defects in cells lacking ''stlA'' include a delay in aggregation, abnormally small aggregation territories, and decreased chemotaxis to cAMP chemotaxis which were restored by addition of MPBD. In addition, expression analysis of cAMP signaling genes revealed lower expression levels of ([/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0273533 carA-2]), ([/gene/DDB_G0281545 acaA]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0276267 gpaB]) in the ''stlA'' null mutant during aggregation, suggesting that ''stlA'' regulates cAMP signaling during early development. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25222736  (Narita et al. 2014)].

DDB_G0282905	Petra Fey	A comprehensive study classified all lysozymes in ''Dictyostelium''. In addition to the 5 known amoeba type lysozymes ([/gene/DDB_G0275123 alyA], [/gene/DDB_G0275119 alyB], [/gene/DDB_G0275121 alyC], [/gene/DDB_G0273197 alyD-1] and [/gene/DDB_G0286229 alyL] ), two new related lysozymes in this family have been identified, [/gene/DDB_G0282905 alyE] and [/gene/DDB_G0282893 alyF]. These genes are next to each other and almost identical, thus possibly a more recent gene duplication. In the past, gene models for these two new lysozymes gave rise to proteins with one or two transmembrane domains. Thus they first have been named alyTM1 and alyTM2, respectively. However, new sequence analyses resulted in updated gene models coding for proteins containing a signal peptide like the other 5 aly family members. Alignment of the 7 proteins allowed the identification of one conserved Asp and one Glu residue in the C- terminal portion of each protein, which might represent the amoeba lysozyme active site [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32061941 (Lamrabet et al. 2020)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 22-APR-2020 PF
DDB_G0275123	Petra Fey	The AlyA protein has been purified from ''Dictyostelium'' cells as a major protein with lysozyme activity. The protein sequence of this lysozyme was backtranslated and used to search the cDNA database, resulting in retrieval of the full ''alyA'' coding sequence. AlyA-GFP localized to numerous small vesicles devoid of other known lysozymal enzymes, distributed throughout the cytoplasm.<br />Deletion of the alyA gene by homologues recombination resulted in a mutant that had only 40% of the wild-type lysozyme activity. When mutant cells were grown on bacteria, they initially made plaques that were only half the size measured in wild-type. However, repeated plating showed that the plaque size for mutants recovered over time, even surpassing that of wild-type. The larger plaque size occurred despite the constant lower level of enzyme activity. Uptake of fluorescently labeled yeast showed that the larger plaque size was due to increased phagocytosis. Thus, the mutant seems to compensates a defect in digestion with an increase in food uptake. <br />A search of ''alyA''-similar ''Dictyostelium'' sequences resulted in the identification of two almost identical adjacent genes, [/gene/DDB_G0275119 alyB] and [/gene/DDB_G0275121 alyC], and two more distantly related genes: ''alyD'', (present in two copies on chromosome 2: [/gene/DDB_G0273197 alyD-1], [/gene/DDB_G0273731 alyD-2]) and [/gene/DDB_G0286229 alyL]. These enzymes are not similar to any other known lysozymes. Thus, it has been suggested that these proteins represent a new class of lysozymes [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15640146  (Mueller et al., 2005)].<br />A comprehensive study classified all lysozymes in ''Dictyostelium''. In addition to the 5 known amoeba like lysozymes ([/gene/DDB_G0275123 alyA], [/gene/DDB_G0275119 alyB], [/gene/DDB_G0275121 alyC], [/gene/DDB_G0273197 alyD-1] and [/gene/DDB_G0286229 alyL] ), two new related lysozymes in this family have been identified, [/gene/DDB_G0282905 alyE] and [/gene/DDB_G0282893 alyF]. Because in the past, gene models for these two new lysozymes gave rise to proteins with transmembrane domains, one or two respectively, they first have been named alyTM1 and alyTM2. However, new sequence analyses resulted in updated gene models coding for proteins containing signal peptides like the other 5 members of the aly family. Alignment of the 7 proteins allowed the identification of one conserved Asp and one Glu residue in the C- terminal portion [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32061941 (Lamrabet et al. 2020)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 20-APR-2020 PF
DDB_G0269284	Robert Dodson	The serine/arginine-rich protein NKAP is highly conserved and in mammals is involved in transcriptional control and splicing. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27997579  (Burgute et al. 2016)] characterized ''Dictostelium'' NKAP and show that it localizes to the nucleus, and that it interacts with the nuclear envelope protein SUN1 ([/gene/DDB_G0272869 sun1]) and the pre-mRNA processing factor prp19 ([/gene/DDB_G0276803 prp19]). NKAP also binds several types of RNA. Attempts to knockout the ''nkaP'' gene were unsuccessful, but mutant strains overexpressing ''nkaP'' contain developmental defects and altered expression profiles for numerous genes suggesting that ''nkaP'' is multifunctional.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-JAN-2017 RD; annotation contributions: PMID:27997579 Angelika Noegel

DDB_G0271806	Robert Dodson	RapGAP3 mediates deactivation of Rap1 ([/gene/DDB_G0291237 rapA]) at the late mound stage of development and plays an important role in regulating cell sorting during apical tip formation by controlling cell-cell adhesion and cell migration. RapGAP3 transiently translocates to the cell cortex in response to chemoattractant stimulation, and localizes to the leading edge of migrating cells. Deletion of ''rapgap3'' results in a severely altered morphogenesis of the multicellular organism at the late mound stage ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19284976 Jeon et al. 2009)]. RapGAP3 binds phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate, and associates with the plasma membrane and the lagging edge of migrating cells. ''rapgap3'' null cells also have defects in chemotaxis to cAMP. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20547830 Zhang et al. 2010)]. The minimal amino acids in the I/LWEQ region required for anterior/posterior localization were investigated by ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24608804 Lee et al. 2014)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28124777 Kim et al. 2017)]. RapGAP3 binds to and is regulated by PI(3,4)P2. Cells lacking RapGAP3 display increased Ras activity, cell spreading and aberrant migratory behavior ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30194235 Li et al. 2018]). <br />Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 13-JAN-2020 RD

DDB_G0285453	Robert Dodson	''racP'' encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Rho family of small GTPases. G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Ras GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP.Basic annotations have been added to this gene, 26-JAN-2021 RD

DDB_G0291974	Robert Dodson	''docA'' encodes a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF, RhoGEF). RhoGEFs are key components of signaling networks in which they activate Rho family GTPases by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP. Microarray analysis revealed that ''docA'' is expressed in prestalk cells, with expression being maintained in all prestalk cells by early culmination ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12796308 Maeda et al. 2003]). A genome-wide screen for cheater mutants identified ''docA'' as a cheater. In ''docA'' null cells sporulation is reduced compared with wild-type cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18272966 Santorelli et al. 2008]). ''docA'' null mutant cells exhibit no growth or developmental defects. However developmentally competent ''docA'' null mutants chemotax with a slightly lower speed and directionality than wild-type cells in a cAMP gradient. The chemotaxis defect is more pronounced in ''docA''/''docD'' ([/gene/DDB_G0284725 docD]) double null mutants which have a polarity defect and a further reduction in speed. Vegetative stage ''docD'' null mutants have a significant decrease in random cell motility compared to wild type cells whereas ''docA'' null mutants show no significant decrease, and ''docA''/''docD'' double null mutant cells have only a slight decrease in speed compared with ''docD'' null mutants. However, expression of either DocA or DocD in the double null mutants rescues the phenotype, suggesting that DocA and DocD may function redundantly. Loss of DocA and DocD also affects the distribution of F-actin polymerization, as the vegetative double null cells appeared incapable of localizing F-actin accumulation at restricted regions of the cortex to create effective membrane protrusions. Taken together, these results suggest that DocA and DocD regulate the actin cytoskeleton and cell motility ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19037099 Para et al. 2009]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 02-JUN-2021 RD
DDB_G0286127	Robert Dodson	''roco8'' encodes a large, multi-domain protein of the Roco family. Roco8 contains two N-terminal DEP domains, a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region, a Roc small GTPase domain, a COR (C-terminal of Roc) domain, and a protein kinase domain. Eleven ''Dictyostelium'' proteins belong to the Roco family: ([/gene/DDB_G0291079 gbpC]), ([/gene/DDB_G0273259 qkgA-1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0269250 pats1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0288251 roco4]), ([/gene/DDB_G0294533 roco5]), ([/gene/DDB_G0279417 roco6]), ([/gene/DDB_G0267472 roco7]), Roco8, ([/gene/DDB_G0288183 roco9]), ([/gene/DDB_G0291710 roco10]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0268636 roco11]).<br />Roco8 is localized to the cytosol and ''roco8'' expression is relatively constant throughout growth and development.

DDB_G0279407	Robert Dodson	Calmodulin is one of the most conserved proteins because it has to form complexes with a large number of diverse proteins in all eukaryotes. The calmodulin encoded by ''calA'' is a small protein in which 133 out of 152 amino acids are identical with the amino acids in human calmodulin [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3785182  (Goldhagen and Clark, 1986)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1493336  (Liu et al. 1992)]. However, the lysine at position 115 is not modified by trimethylation as it is in mammals but is conjugated to ubiquitin [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6087882  (Marshak et al. 1984)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2985583  (Gregori et al. 1985)]. Like all other calmodulins, as well as the regulatory subunit of calcineurin ([/gene/DDB_G0267446 cnbA]) it has two EF hand domains that bind calcium. The kinetic constants for binding and release of calcium are higher for calmodulin than for other EF hand proteins, making it well suited for mediating calcium signaling. Calmodulin purified from Dictyostelium interacts with bovine phosphodiesterase, calcium ATPase and troponin [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6259174  (Bazari and Clarke, 1981)]. Ca++/calmodulin binds to many Dictyostelium proteins including a ribosomal protein L19 ([/gene/DDB_G0281565 rpl19]), cyclin-dependent kinase ([/gene/DDB_G0288677 cdk5]) and nucleomorphin ([/gene/DDB_G0269114 numA]) among others [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6313344  (Maruta et al. 1983)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3409979  (Lydan and O'Day, 1988)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1719589  (Winckler et al. 1991)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1744106  (Sonnemann et al. 1991)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11919178  (Myre and O'Day, 2002)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17897809  (Catalano and O'Day, 2008)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23063531  (Huber et al. 2012)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23974243  (Huber, 2013)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25518940  (Sugden et al. 2014)]. Calmodulin also serves as the light chain for the unconventional myosins MyoA ([/gene/DDB_G0280039 myoA]), and MyoE ([/gene/DDB_G0288679 myoE]) where it provides calcium control [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21671662  (Crawley et al. 2011)]. Cells in which the levels of calmodulin mRNA and protein are reduced about two fold as the result of expression of calA antisense RNA are unable to complete cytokinesis and so become highly multinucleated before dying [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1493336  (Liu et al. 1992)]. Calmodulin is also associated with an unconventional myosin on the membranes of contractile vacuoles [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1629238  (Zhu and Clarke, 1992)].

DDB_G0281385	Robert Dodson	''rasC'' encodes a G protein of the Ras family of small GTPases. G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEF, rasGEF) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAP, rasGAP) inactivate Ras GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. RasC activation is abolished in a ''gefA'' null mutant ([/gene/DDB_G0284329 gefA]), indicating that ''gefA'' is the GEF which activates RasC ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11500376 Lim et al. 2001]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17380187 Kae et al. 2007]). <br />''rasC'' is expressed throughout the life cycle with peak expression during development at 20 hours, and with expression enriched in prestalk cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11500376 Lim et al. 2001]). ''rasC'' null cells are incapable of aggregation, but this defect is rescued by exogenous cAMP pulses. ''rasC'' null cells do not produce cAMP in response to 2'-deoxy-cAMP, indicating that G-protein-coupled cAMP receptor activation of adenylate cyclase is regulated by RasC. ''rasC'' null cells also exhibit decreased chemotaxis to cAMP during development and reduced phosphorylation of protein kinase B (AKT/PKB) ([/gene/DDB_G0268620 pkbA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11500376 Lim et al. 2001]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16885420 Bolourani et al. 2006]). Prior to development, vegetative ''rasC'' null cells exhibit reduced random motility, are less polarized and have an altered F-actin distribution. They also have an increased number of lateral pseudopods and an increased rate of endocytosis. ''rasC'' null cells chemotax poorly to folate and exhibit reduced F-actin accumulation, reduced ERK2 ([/gene/DDB_G0283903 erkB]) phosphorylation and reduced PKB phosphorylation in response to folate, indicating that RasC is also involved in transducing chemotactic signals in vegetative cells. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15878331 Lim et al. 2005]). <br />RasC is a crucial mediator of the chemotactic response to cAMP. Activated RasC binds to the catalytic domain of tor ([/gene/DDB_G0281569 tor]) and stimulates TORC2 to phosphorylate downstream protein kinases, PKB and PKBR1 ([/gene/DDB_G0290157 pkgB]), as well as to activate adenylyl cyclase ([/gene/DDB_G0281545 acaA]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27172998  (Khanna et al. 2016)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18635356  (Kamimura et al. 2008)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20660630  (Cai et al. 2010)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19763972  (Kamimura et al. 2009)]. Rap1 ([/gene/DDB_G0291237 rapA]) positively regulates the RasC-mediated activation of TORC2, suggesting that dual Ras/Rap1 regulation of TORC2 may allow for integration of Ras and Rap1 signaling pathways in directed cell migration. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27172998 Khanna et al. 2016)]. The Sca1 Ras signaling complex, which includes the RasGEFs GefA and GefH ([/gene/DDB_G0276963 gefH]), and the scaffold protein Sca1 ([/gene/DDB_G0277843 scaA]), is recruited to the plasma membrane of the leading edge of chemotaxing cells during cAMP stimulation where it regulates F-actin dynamics and signal relay by controlling the activation of RasC and the downstream TORC2-PKB pathway. PKB and PKBR1 phosphorylate Sca1 and regulate the membrane localization of the Sca1 complex, and thereby RasC activity, in a negative feedback fashion ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20493808 Charest et al. 2010]). In ''pkaC'' ([/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC]) null cells stimulated with cAMP, RasC activation is decreased and Sca1 fails to localize to the plasma membrane, indicating that PKA ([/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC], [/gene/DDB_G0279413 pkaR]) is also needed for optimal RasC activation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28302905 Scavello et al. 2017)]. RasC phosphorylation of AKT/PKB is also dependent on the small GTPase RacE ([/gene/DDB_G0280975 racE]). In contrast to the prevailing view that the GDP-bound forms of G proteins are inactive, RacE-GDP promotes AKT/PKB phosphorylation by assembling a super-complex with RasC-GTP and mTORC2. This super-complex formation is controlled by the cAMP-induced phosphorylation of RacE-GDP by glycogen synthase kinase GSK-3.

DDB_G0291976	Robert Dodson	''racD'' encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Rho family of small GTPases. G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Ras GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. <br />''racD'' mRNA is expressed during the growth phase, with a slight increase in expression during early development, but then mRNA levels slowly decrease at the start of aggregation until the end of development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8294042 Bush et al. 1993]). RacD is an atypical member of the Rho GTPase family. RacD lacks a C-terminal prenylation motif, a signal for attachment of a lipid moiety, geranylgeranyl or farnesyl, characteristic of other Rho proteins. The prenylation motif has been demonstrated to contribute to the association of Rho proteins with membranes ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11222756 Rivero et al. 2001]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 08-MAY-2020 RD
DDB_G0274383	Robert Dodson	''pdeD'' encodes the cGMP-stimulated cGMP phosphodiesterase which has a beta-lactamase catalytic site followed by two cNMP binding sites, the same order of domains found in the cAMP-activated cAMP phosphodiesterase ''pdeE'' ([/gene/DDB_G0276027 pdeE]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12429832  (Bosgraaf et al. 2002)]. ''pdeD'' knock-out strains are "streamers" which are characterized by extensive streams during aggregation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12429831  (Meima et al. 2002)]. ''stmF'' mutants isolated from chemically mutagenized populations are also "streamers" and have greatly reduced cGMP phosphodiesterase activity, but differ from ''pdeD'' null mutants with respect to cAMP-induced calcium uptake [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15878705  (Lusche et al. 2005)]. cGMP accumulates to high levels in ''pdeD'' null mutants leading to the activation of myosin light chain kinase A ([/gene/DDB_G0279925 mlkA]) during aggregation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12198158  (Bosgraaf et al. 2002)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16546177  (Goldberg et al. 2006)]. cGMP stimulates phosphorylation of both the myosin regulatory light chain and the myosin heavy chain resulting in an increase in suppression of lateral pseudopods and an improvement in chemotaxis to a stable source of cAMP [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12198158  (Bosgraaf et al. 2002)]. However, knockout mutants of ''pdeD'' are defective in chemotaxis to cAMP, and PdeD is phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase GskA ([/gene/DDB_G0272110 gskA]), revealing ''pdeD'' to be a component of the GskA signaling pathway coordinating cell migration in response to cAMP [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29626371  (Baumgardner et al. 2018)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 01-NOV-2018 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

CARMIL activates Arp2/3-dependent actin nucleation and binds capping protein through its N-terminal region and the SH3 domain of MyoB and MyoC through its proline-rich C-terminal domain. ''carmil'' null mutants display defects in fluid phase endocytosis and the formation of macropinocytic cups, and a reduction in cellular F-actin levels. CARMIL localizes in dynamic actin-rich cellular extensions, including the leading edge of chemotaxing cells and macropinocytic extensions [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11425877  (Jung et al. 2001)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15726806  (Cvrckova et al. 2004)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 17-JAN-2020 RD

''myoA'' encodes a short myosin I with a conserved head region and a tail region that is not predicted to form an alpha-helical structure or have coiled-coil interactions [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2519618  (Titus et al. 1989)]. It associates with calmodulin ([/gene/DDB_G0279407 calA]) which provides calcium control [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21671662  (Crawley et al. 2011)].

DDB_G0275323	Robert Dodson	''tipD'' was isolated from a REMI mutant that was picked because its development was arrested when multiple tips formed on aggregates ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10402673 Stege et al. 1999)]. It encodes a 67 kDa coiled-coil protein with a N-terminal domain that is similar to the yeast autophagy protein ATG16. In yeast, ATG16 associates non-covalently with ATG5-ATG12 to form a complex which acts as an E3 ligase to link Atg8 to phosphatidyl-ethanolamine of the growing membrane of the autophagosome. The product of ''tipD'' has been shown to interact with ATG5 ([/gene/DDB_G0289881 atg5]) in a 2-hybrid yeast assay ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26246495 Mesquita et al. 2015)]. ''tipD'' null mutants have defects in autophagy, phagocytosis and degradation of ubiquitin-marked proteins indicating that this ATG16 homolog may be involved in several steps of membrane trafficking ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25996471 Munoz-Braceras et al. 2015)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25878144 Xiong et al. 2015)]. ''tipD'' null mutants also have abnormal cell sorting behavior and severely reduced fruiting body and spore production. The multitipped phenotype of mutants in tipD is similar to that of mutants in other autophagy genes ''atg6'' ([/gene/DDB_G0269244 atg6A]), ''atg7'' ([/gene/DDB_G0271096 atg7]), ''atg9'' ([/gene/DDB_G0285323 atg9]), ''atg101'' ([/gene/DDB_G0288287 atg101]), and ''tipC'' ([/gene/DDB_G0267422 tipC]). TipD directly interacts with subunits of the proteasomal degradation complex PSMD1 ([/gene/DDB_G0287953 psmD1]) and PSMD2 ([/gene/DDB_G0293752 psmD2]) and mediates their degradation by autophagy, suggesting a role for ''tipD'' in linking autophagy and the ubiquitin proteasome system. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30269947 Xiong et al. 2018)]. Core autophagy genes are upregulated in ''atg12'' ([/gene/DDB_G0282929 atg12]), and ''tipD'' mutants while genes related to cell motility and phagocytosis are down-regulated. An increase in ubiquitin-positive protein aggregates with a corresponding decrease in proteasomal activity in these mutants reveals that the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is dependent on intact autophagy for full activity ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30669443 Fischer et al. 2019)]. ''atg5'' single, ''atg5''/''atg12'' double, and ''atg5''/''atg12''/''tipD'' triple knockout mutants revealed similar defects in the conjugation of ATG8 to phosphatidylethanolamine, development, and cell viability indicating that Atg5, Atg12, and TipD act as a functional unit in canonical autophagy. However, distinct and sometimes opposite phenotypes in growth, macropinocytosis, phagocytosis, and proteasomal activity in these mutants reveal autophagy-independent functions for these genes ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32397394 Karow et al. 2020)]Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 08-DEC-2020 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis and Ricardo Escalante
DDB_G0270124	Robert Dodson	''rasX'' encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Ras family of small GTPases. G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs, rasGEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs, rasGAPs) inactivate Ras GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. An analysis of ''Dictyostelium'' ras family genes reveals that ''rasU'' ([/gene/DDB_G0270138 rasU]), ''rasV'' ([/gene/DDB_G0270736 rasV]), ''rasW'' ([/gene/DDB_G0270122 rasW]), ''rasX'', ''rasY'' ([/gene/DDB_G0270126 rasY]) and ''rasZ'' ([/gene/DDB_G0270140 rasZ]) form a separate phylogenetic clade ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29614268 Park et al. 2018]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 12-MAR-2020 RD
DDB_G0268622	Robert Dodson	''rac1B'' encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Rho family of small GTPases. G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Ras GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. Myosin M ([/gene/DDB_G0292262 myoM]) has GEF activity towards Rac1B ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11208126 Geissler et al. 2000]) and RacGEF1 ([/gene/DDB_G0277987 gxcA]) also has weak GEF activity for Rac1B ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15470506 Park et al. 2004]). DGAP1 ([/gene/DDB_G0287585 rgaA]) and GAPA ([/gene/DDB_G0269140 gapA]) are possible GAPs for Rac1B ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10825297 Dumontier et al. 2000]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20375144 Lee et al. 2010]). Rac1B has multiple binding partners that may function as downstream effectors. These include: protein kinase PakA ([/gene/DDB_G0269166 pakA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10545500 Chung et al. 1999]), myosin heavy chain kinase PakB ([/gene/DDB_G0276459 pakB]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15509655 de la Roche et al. 2005]), protein kinase PakC ([/gene/DDB_G0267450 pakC]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15470506 Park et al. 2004]), WASP ([/gene/DDB_G0293834 wasA]), WASP-B ([/gene/DDB_G0272811 wasB]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23791739  (Chung et al. 2013)] and coronin A ([/gene/DDB_G0267382 corA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24347642 Swaminathan et al. 2013]). Rac1B also binds to the Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 1 RhoGDI1 ([/gene/DDB_G0291077 rdiA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12163018 Imai et al. 2002]). ''rac1B'' is induced during sexual maturation but expression is reduced immediately after cell fusion, suggesting that Rac1B may be involved in cell/cell interactions during the sexual cycle ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16573737 Muramoto et al. 2005]). Expression of ''rac1B'' is upregulated in response to intracellular ''Mycobacterium marinum'' and ''Legionella pneumophila'' infection ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31823727 Kjellin et al. 2019]). <br />''rac1B'' is highly similar to two additional ''Dictyostelium'' rho GTPases: ''rac1A'' ([/gene/DDB_G0277869 rac1A]) and ''rac1C'' ([/gene/DDB_G0282365 rac1C]). Expression of the three ''rac1'' genes is low during growth but increases 3-fold during aggregation before again declining to growth-stage levels during the slug stage ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8294042 Bush et al. 1993]). Overexpression of ''rac1'' genes results in increased filopodium formation, while constitutively active Rac1 mutants are severely impaired in growth, motility and endocytosis. In addition, these mutants are delayed in development and display defects in cytokinesis and F-actin organization. These results indicate that the Rac1 GTPases mediate signaling cascades regulating processes such as cell motility, endocytosis and cytokinesis that depend on the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in ''Dictyostelium'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10545500 Chung et al. 1999]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10825297 Dumontier et al. 2000]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10962483 Palmieri et al. 2000]). At the leading edge of migrating cells activated Rac1 participates in Scar/WAVE ([/gene/DDB_G0285253 scrA])-mediated actin polymerization and pseudopod extension. At the trailing edge activated Rac1 forms a complex with DGAP1 and the actin-binding proteins cortexillin I ([/gene/DDB_G0289483 ctxA]) and cortexillin II ([/gene/DDB_G0276893 ctxB]) enabling proper cell retraction ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20375144 Lee et al. 2010]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22302991 Filic et al. 2012]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22891261 Veltman et al. 2012]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23503127 Faix et al. 2013]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26940518 Rivero et al. 2016]).

DDB_G0274605	Robert Dodson	''gefR'' encodes a Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF, RasGEF). rasGEFs are key components of signaling networks in which they activate Ras family small GTPases by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP. GefR is dephosphosphorylated in response to activated RasG ([/gene/DDB_G0293434 rasG]) expression; however a ''gefR'' null mutant displayed no discernible phenotypes in either growth, development or motility ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15352238 Secko et al. 2004)]. A large-scale proteomic analysis revealed that GefR is also dephosphorylated in response to the prestalk inducer Differentiation Inducing Factor-1 (DIF-1) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25518940 Sugden et al. 2014)]. ''gefR'' is expressed weakly during growth but with increased expression levels during development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16086850 Wilkins et al. 2005)]. In response to cAMP, RasG activation was greatly reduced in a ''gefR'' null mutant, indicating that GefR has GEF activity towards RasG ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17380187 Kae et al. 2007)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 07-MAY-2021 RD

DDB_G0274569	Petra Fey	''acgA'' encodes one of the three adenylyl cyclases in ''Dictyostelium''. AcgA has a CHASE domain flanked by transmembrane domains that acts as an extracellular sensor in other receptors. It is expressed during culmination (T=18 to T=24 hrs) and acts as an osmosensor negatively regulating spore germination through PKA ([/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC], [/gene/DDB_G0279413 pkaR]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8798577  van Es et al. 1996 ]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10463155  Cotter et al. 1999)]. AgcA forms a homodimer and was characterized as the first intramolecular osmosensor in eukaryotes [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14718564  (Saran and Schaap 2004)]. The SDF-1 pathway acts through AcgA and PKA to prepare prespore and prestalk cells for terminal differentiation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21602484  (Anjard et al. 2011)]. The only other CHASE domain in a ''Dictyostelium'' protein is the binding site for SDF-2 in the receptor histidine kinase, DhkA ([/gene/DDB_G0280961 dhkA]).Basic annotations have been added to this gene, 22-JUN-2015 PF; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

DDB_G0291710	Robert Dodson	''roco10'' encodes a large, multi-domain protein of the Roco family. Roco10 contains an N-terminal RhoGAP domain, a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region, a Roc small GTPase domain, a COR (C-terminal of Roc) domain, a protein kinase domain and a C-terminal Kelch-RGS-Kelch module. Eleven ''Dictyostelium'' proteins belong to the Roco family: ([/gene/DDB_G0291079 gbpC]), ([/gene/DDB_G0273259 qkgA-1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0269250 pats1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0288251 roco4]), ([/gene/DDB_G0294533 roco5]), ([/gene/DDB_G0279417 roco6]), ([/gene/DDB_G0267472 roco7]), ([/gene/DDB_G0286127 roco8]), ([/gene/DDB_G0288183 roco9]), Roco10 and ([/gene/DDB_G0268636 roco11]).<br />Roco10 is localized to the cytosol and ''roco10'' expression is relatively constant throughout growth and development. Disruption of the ''roco10'' gene did not result in any significant developmental defects ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20348387 van Egmond and van Haastert 2010]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 25-OCT-2021 RD
DDB_G0280955	Robert Dodson	''dsgg'' encodes a Disgorgin, a Rab GTPase-activating protein (GAP, rabGAP). RabGAPs are key components of signal transduction networks in which they inactivate Rab GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. Disgorgin localizes to the contractile vacuole (CV) membrane during the late charging phase. Disgorgin binds to and has strong GAP activity towards Rab GTPase 8A ([/gene/DDB_G0280043 rab8A]), which also localizes to the contractile vacuole. Disgogrin also binds to a dominant negative Rab11A ([/gene/DDB_G0269238 rab11A]) mutant. ''dsgg'' null cells have enlarged contractile vacuoles as a result of impaired contractile vacuole-plasma membrane fusion.<br />Disgorgin, along with Drainin ([/gene/DDB_G0269130 phgA]), Rab8A and Rab11A function in a signaling pathway to regulate CV fusion with the plasma membrane and subsequent CV discharging. In response to hypo-osmotic stress, Rab GTPase Rab11A is activated and recruits Drainin to the contractile vacuole membrane. Disgorgin and Rab8A function downstream of Drainin and rab11A to mediate contractile vacuole-plasma membrane fusion which is then followed by the discharge of water out of the cell. The strong interaction between Disgorgin and dominant-negative Rab11A suggests a possible feedback pathway between the two. In addition, LvsA ([/gene/DDB_G0269150 lvsA]) and LvsD ([/gene/DDB_G0271502 lvsD]) are also involved in the regulation of CV formation. Disrupting ''lvsA'' or overexpressing LvsD suppresses the large CV phenotype in ''dsgg'' null cells, whereas overexpressing LvsA or disrupting ''lvsD'' leads to the extended enlargement of CVs in ''dsgg'' null cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18636095 Du et al. 2008]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-NOV-2021 RD

DDB_G0279149	Robert Dodson	''pip5k3'' encodes a phosphoinositide kinase that plays a role in early phagosome maturation. In ''pip5k3'' null cells delivery of vacuolar ATPase components ([/gene/DDB_G0291858 vatM]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0277401 vatB]) and the protease cathepsin D ([/gene/DDB_G0279411 ctsD]) to phagosomes is inhibited, reducing the ability of cells to acidify newly formed phagosomes. As a consequence, ''pip5k3'' null cells are unable to generate an effective antimicrobial environment and kill captured bacteria. ''pip5k3'' null cells are also more susceptible to infection by the intracellular pathogen ''Legionella pneumophila'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30730983 Buckley et al. 2019]). ''pip5k3'' was identified in a REMI mutant screen as a clone with an abnormal fruiting body morphology, and ''pip5k3'' null mutants created by homologous recombination had enlarged lower stalks with maturing spores becoming increasingly vacuolated. ''pip5k3'' null mutants initially have normal pre-spore differentiation; however, at low cell density, a proportion of the pre-spore cells at the base of the structure then transdifferentiate into stalk-like cells with a single large vacuole and cellulose wall; at high cell density, the majority of pre-spore cells transdifferentiate into stalk-like cells. (Yamada et al. 2021, PMID:34490246).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 14-DEC-2021 RD
DDB_G0287855	Robert Dodson	PirA (PIR121) is a member of the Scar/WAVE complex, consisting of (Scar) ([/gene/DDB_G0285253 scrA]), PirA, ([/gene/DDB_G0279175 hspc300]), ([/gene/DDB_G0267956 abiA]), and ([/gene/DDB_G0274519 napA]). In migrating cells, the Scar/WAVE complex regulates the production of lamellipods and pseudopods through Arp2/3 complex activation. The Scar/WAVE complex localizes to the front of pseudopods and the tips of filopods, cell-cell contact zones, and the cell leading edge ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22891261 Veltman et al. 2012]). PirA interacts with Rac GTPase ([/gene/DDB_G0277869 rac1A]), ([/gene/DDB_G0268622 rac1B]), ([/gene/DDB_G0282365 rac1C]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30393033 Schaks et al. 2018]) and polarity regulator Leep1 ([/gene/DDB_G0293920 leep1]) (Yang, et al 2021, PMID:33978708). PirA and NapA also interact to form an independent heterodimeric subcomplex prior to formation of the mature Scar/WAVE complex ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21701600 Linkner et al. 2011]).<br />In ''pirA'' null mutants in an AX3 background, Scar is almost undetectable by Western blotting. ''pirA'' null mutant cells are abnormally large, have a high F-actin content, and extend pseudopods at more than three times the rate of wild type cells but have a decreased overall cell speed. Double ''pirA''/''scrA'' null mutants show none of the phenotypes exhibited by ''pirA'' single mutants, and instead appear to have a simple ''scrA'' null phenotype ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12956949 Blagg et al. 2003]). Disruption of ''pirA'' in an NC4A2 background however produces opposing phenotypes: ''pirA'' knockouts are smaller, rounder and make almost no discernible pseudopods, but they can chemotax efficiently ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16822579 Pollitt et al. 2006]). In ''pirA'' null mutants in an AX2 background (''pirA''/AX2 null) Scar, AbiA, and Hspc300 levels are severely decreased. ''pirA''/AX2 null cells largely lacked macropinocytic cups, filopods and pseudopods, but formed many bleb-like protrusions at the cell front. ''pirA''/AX2 null cells also have defects in cytokinesis and cell motility ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28889942 Litschko et al. 2017]).<br />GTP-bound Rac1 interacts with PirA, and PirA mutants in which the Rac1 binding site is deleted reveal that Rac1 binding with PirA is required for Scar/WAVE complex activation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30393033 Schaks et al. 2018]). Leep1 interacts with both ScrA and PirA, and the similarity in phenotypes between overexpression of Leep1 and disruption of Scar suggests that Leep1 acts as a negative regulator of the Scar/WAVE complex.

DDB_G0274455	Robert Dodson	Besides ''mhcA'' ([/gene/DDB_G0286355 mhcA]) that encodes the classical myosin heavy chain, ''Dictyostelium'' carries genes for 12 unconventional myosins. The first 5 unconventional myosins ([/gene/DDB_G0280039 myoA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0289117 myoB]), ([/gene/DDB_G0276617 myoC]), ([/gene/DDB_G0275447 myoD]), ([/gene/DDB_G0288679 myoE]), were isolated from whole genome plasmid clones by low stringency probing with portions of the head region of ''mhcA''. The next 6 unconventional myosins ([/gene/DDB_G0289177 myoF]), ([/gene/DDB_G0276363 myoG]), ([/gene/DDB_G0289447 myoH]), ''myoI'', ([/gene/DDB_G0272112 myoJ]), ([/gene/DDB_G0274575 myoK]) were recognized in large YAC clones that represent the whole genome [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7937787  (Titus et al. 1994)]. ''myoI'' encodes a class VII unconventional myosin, MyoI, that is involved in phagocytosis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7937787  (Titus et al. 1994)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10574761  (Titus, 1999)]. Like MyoG, there are two MyTH4 domains and a FERM domain in MyoI that can bind to both F-actin and microtubules [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21875595  (Moen et al. 2011)]. MyoI is enriched in filopods and phagocytic cups and is found at the leading edge of migrating cells [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11267868  (Tuxworth et al. 2001)]. MyoI appears to play a role in adhesion to particles as well as to the substratum through its direct interaction with talin A ([/gene/DDB_G0290481 talA]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16355532  (Titus, 2005)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15826949  (Tuxworth et al. 2005)]. ''myoI'' mRNA is relatively abundant throughout early development and only decreases after 11 hrs of development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. ''myoI'' is induced during early germination and plays a role in spore swelling [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15470238  (Xu et al. 2004)]. ''myoI'' null mutants have defects in spore germination, phagocytosis, filopodium formation and both cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15470238  (Xu et al. 2004)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10574761  (Titus, 1999)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11267868  (Tuxworth et al. 2001)]. MyoI fails to target efficiently to the cell cortex in ''vasP'' ([/gene/DDB_G0289541 vasP]) null cells. The actin regulator VasP produces a cortical actin network at the leading-edge cortex that activates MyoI, and together, VasP and MyoI drive filopodia initiation by further bundling and polymerizing actin.

DDB_G0276869	Robert Dodson	''psvA'' encodes the spore coat protein SP35 that is stored in prespore vesicles and released during sporulation such that it can bind cellulose to help form the middle of the trilaminar surface layer [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2049876  (Hildebrandt et al. 1991)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9692967  (Zhang, Brown and West 1998)]. There is a signal sequence at the N-terminus that directs transport across membranes. A cDNA clone derived from psvA mRNA, referred to as EB4, was one of the first prespore specific probes [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6301681  (Barklis and Lodish 1983)]. The mRNA starts to accumulate at 11 hrs of development when it is no longer complexed with an antisense transcript [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1995398  (Hildebrandt et al. 1991)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1555240  (Hildebrandt and Nellen 1992)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. Both the 2.2 kb mRNA and a 1.8 kb antisense transcript from the opposite strand of ''psvA'' are synthesized during early development leading to the formation of double stranded RNA that is unstable.

DDB_G0286773	Petra Fey	GflB has been identified as a novel RacE-binding protein which contains an N-terminal lipid- binding domain, a Ras GEF domain, and a Rho GAP domain. GflB interacts with both Rho and Ras GTPases and controls their activities in response to cAMP. A ''gflB'' knockout shows that GflB is important for spatially restricting intracellular chemotactic signals at the leading edge of migrating cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27009206  Senoo et al. 2016)]. <br />GflB directly couples the cAMP receptor to Rap1 ([/gene/DDB_G0291237 rapA]). Localizing to the leading edge it binds active (GTP-bound) G-alpha 2. GflB functions as a Ga2-activated, Rap1-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, required to balance Ras and Rap signaling. The nucleotide exchange on Rap1 induces a major rearrangement of the cytoskeleton and results in the recruitment of additional GflB to the leading edge.The kinetics of GflB translocation to the leading edge of chemotaxing cells are fine-tuned by GSK3 phosphorylation ([/gene/DDB_G0272110 gskA]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27237792  Liu et al. 2016)].<br />During vegetative growth, ''gflB''-knockout cells are flatter and more polarized, whereas GflB-overproducing cells are rounder. The ''gflB''- cells exhibited impaired crown formation and particularly retraction, resulting in more crowns (macropinocytic cups) per cell and longer crown lifetimes. Accordingly, ''gflB''- cells showed defects in macropinocytosis, phagocytosis and cytokinesis. An N-terminal region was shown to bind F-actin directly. Expressing several deletion constructs found the N-terminal region essential for cortical localization including crowns, a downstream basic region might recruit the protein to the cortex through its lipid binding property. Both the RasGEF domain and NKD (nankyrin domain)) are important for GflB function, the NKD may modulate the cortical binding. Thus GflB acts as a key regulator of actin-driven membrane protrusions during processes such as phagocytosi and cytokinesis, possibly by modulating Rap1 signaling pathways ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28778987  Inaba et al. 2017)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 08-MAR-2019 PF
DDB_G0277869	Robert Dodson	''rac1A'' encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Rho family of small GTPases. G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Ras GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. RacGEFs for Rac1A include ''docD'' ([/gene/DDB_G0284725 docD]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19037099 Para et al. 2009]), zizB ([/gene/DDB_G0293084 zizB]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22366457 Pakes et al. 2012]), ''gflB'' ([/gene/DDB_G0286773 gflB]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27009206 Senoo et al. 2016]), Myosin M ([/gene/DDB_G0292262 myoM]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11208126 Geissler et al. 2000]) and possibly gxcDD ([/gene/DDB_G0279733 gxcDD]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17584488 Mondal et al. 2007]). DRG ([/gene/DDB_G0291978 xacA]) contains both GAP and GEF domains and displays GEF activity and weak GAP activity for Rac1A ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11285226 Manstein et al. 2001]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9188459 Ludbrook et al. 1997]). Although the IQGAP-related protein DGAP1 ([/gene/DDB_G0287585 rgaA]) binds to Rac1A, it does not affect its GTPase activity ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9739079 Faix et al. 1998]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10825297 Dumontier et al. 2000]). Filamin ([/gene/DDB_G0269100 abpC]) and activated Rac1A associate with the rasGAP GAPA ([/gene/DDB_G0269140 gapA]) to regulate actin re-modelling. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21085675 Mondal et al. 2010]). <br />Rac1A has multiple binding partners that may function as downstream effectors. These include: the protein kinase PakA ([/gene/DDB_G0269166 pakA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12952073 Mueller-Taubenberger et al. 2002]), PakC ([/gene/DDB_G0267450 pakC]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15470506 Park et al. 2004]), Lissencephaly-related protein LIS1 ([/gene/DDB_G0288375 lis1]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15800059 Rehberg et al. 2005]), diaphanous-related formin H ([/gene/DDB_G0285589 forH]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15908944 Schirenbeck et al. 2005]), the myosin heavy chain kinase PakB ''pakB'' ([/gene/DDB_G0276459 pakB]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15509655 de la Roche et al. 2005]), coronin A ([/gene/DDB_G0267382 corA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24347642 Swaminathan et al. 2013]) and WASP ([/gene/DDB_G0293834 wasA]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31786060  (Amato et al. 2019)]. Rac1A also binds to the Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 1 RhoGDI1 ([/gene/DDB_G0291077 rdiA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12163018 Imai et al. 2002]).<br />''rac1A'' is highly similar to two additional ''Dictyostelium'' rho GTPases: ''rac1B'' ([/gene/DDB_G0268622 rac1B]) and ''rac1C'' ([/gene/DDB_G0282365 rac1C]). Expression of the three ''rac1'' genes is low during growth but increases 3-fold during aggregation before again declining to growth-stage levels during the slug stage ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8294042 Bush et al. 1993]). Expression levels for ''rac1A'' are 2.5 fold higher than for either ''rac1B'' or ''rac1C''. Overexpression of ''rac1'' genes results in increased filopodium formation, while constitutively active Rac1A and Rac1C mutants are severely impaired in growth, motility and endocytosis. In addition, these mutants were delayed in development and displayed defects in cytokinesis and F-actin organization ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10825297 Dumontier et al. 2000]). These results indicate that the Rac1 GTPases mediate processes such as cell motility, endocytosis and cytokinesis in ''Dictyostelium'' that depend on the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Activated Rac1A recruits either DGAP1 or GAPA into a protein complex with cortexillin I ([/gene/DDB_G0289483 ctxA]) and cortexillin II ([/gene/DDB_G0276893 ctxB]). Assembly of this complex is necessary for the recruitment of cortexillin to the midzone of a dividing cell and for the formation of a cleavage furrow during cytokinesis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11447112 Faix et al. 2001]). cAMP stimulation activates ''rac1A'' and it then plays a role in signaling networks that lead to both protrusion at the front and retraction at the back of ''Dictyostelium'' cells. One population of activated Rac1A accumulates at the leading edge while a distinct population accumulates at the rear. At the leading edge of migrating cells activated Rac1A participates in Scar/WAVE ([/gene/DDB_G0285253 scrA])-mediated actin polymerization and pseudopod extension. At the trailing edge activated Rac1A forms a complex with DGAP1 and the actin-binding proteins cortexillin I and cortexillin II enabling proper cell retraction ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22302991 Filic et al. 2012]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22891261 Veltman et al. 2012]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23503127 Faix et al. 2013]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26940518 Rivero et al. 2016]). Activated Rac1A and RacC ([/gene/DDB_G0293526 racC]) both regulate, and are regulated by, WASP. WASP interacts with activated Rac genes via its CRIB motif, and this interaction is required for WASP to generate pseudopods in the absence of SCAR/WAVE. However, this interaction also provides a means for WASP to remove activated Racs from the membrane via endocytosis. Thus, WASP contributes to front-rear cell polarity by controlling localization and cellular levels of activated Rac.

Rab subfamily small GTPases in many organisms are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking. Rab11B is similar to human RAB11A, which regulates endocytic recycling. The ''rab11B'' gene is expressed at a uniform, but low level throughout growth and development. ''rab11B'' null mutants showed no defects in growth, endocytosis or development, suggesting that the function of ''rab11B'' may be redundant with other ''rab'' genes in ''Dictyostelium'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9632105 Dragoi et al. 1998]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 07-SEP-2020 RD
DDB_G0281337	Robert Dodson	''rab14'' (''rabD'') encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Rab family of small GTPases. G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rab GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Rab GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. DRG ([/gene/DDB_G0291978 xacA]) contains both GAP and GEF domains and displays GAP activity for Rab14 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11285226 Manstein et al. 2001]). Disgorgin ([/gene/DDB_G0280955 dsgg]) exhibits weak GAP activity toward Rab14 while drainin ([/gene/DDB_G0269130 phgA]) binds but does not exhibit GAP activity to Rab14 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18636095 Du et al. 2008 ]). ''rab14'' is expressed at a relatively constant level throughout growth and development and is associated with the lysosomal membrane and the contractile vacuole complex [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7876348  (Bush et al. 1994)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7929276  (Temesvari et al. 1994)]. Rab14 also localizes to the Legionella-containing vacuole [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18980612  (Urwyler et al. 2009)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28183814  (Schmolders et al. 2017)]. <br />''rab14'' is involved in signaling networks that regulate membrane traffic between the endosomal pathway and the contractile vacuole. ''rab14'' regulates phagocytosis and plays a role in the regulation of lysosome and phagosome fusion. Cells overexpressing dominant negative Rab14 swell and lyse when placed in water, and have an aberrant contractile vacuole morphology. Constitutively active ''rab14'' localizes to the membranes of large acidic lysosomes and these cells show an increased rate of fusion of early endosomes. In addition, in constitutively active ''rab14'' cells the phagocytosis rate was more than twice that of wt cells and phagosome-phagosome fusion occurred at five times the rate of wt cells. Dominant-negative ''rab14'' cells have opposing phenotypes with a decrease in both the rate of phagocytosis and the rate of phagosome-phagosome fusion [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8898366  (Bush et al. 1996)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12186956  (Harris and Cardelli 2002]). ''lvsB'' ([/gene/DDB_G0271504 lvsB]) null mutants have defects in lysosome organization and biogenesis, and LvsB contributes to lysosome function by antagonizing the function of Rab14. Expression of activated Rab14 phenocopies the loss of LvsB, causing inappropriate heterotypic fusion between lysosomes and post-lysosomes, while expression of inactivated Rab14 suppresses the phenotype of LvsB null cells and restores their lysosomal size and segregation from post-lysosomes. These results suggest that LvsB binds to late lysosomes and promotes the inactivation of Rab14, which then allows the lysosomes to mature into post-lysosomes for eventual secretion ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23387437 Kypri et al. 2013]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 18-AUG-2020 RD
DDB_G0288047	Robert Dodson	There are six subfamilies of DNA methyltransferases. ''Dictyostelium'' has a single cytosine-5-methyltransferase, DnmA, which belongs to the dnmt2 subfamily. Members of this family have weak or undetectable methylase activity. When activity is observed, it is against substrates containing a thymidine 3' of the cytosine, rather than a guanine as other cytosine-5-methyltransferases ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15689527 Ponger and Li, 2005]). <br />Consistent with these predictions, no methylation has been detected on CG islands in the Dictyostelium genome ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1713034 Smith and Ratner, 1991]). Instead, low levels of DNA methylation has been observed on sites with no obvious sequence preferences. DNA methylation is dependent on the presence of DnmA, as it is greatly reduced in the null mutant, indicating that DnmA has DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase activity ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16282589 Kuhlmann et al., 2005], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16400165 Katoh et al., 2006]). Kuhlmann and colleagues have noticed that after several passages through growth and development stages, expression of two retrotransposable elements, Skipper and DIRS-1, is greatly increased in the ''dnmA'' null mutant. Null mutants for two other genes involved in RNAi silencing, [/gene/DDB_G0273051 drnA-1] and [/gene/DDB_G0283023 hcpA], also exhibit increased expression of Skipper and DIRS-1. Katoh ''et al.'' report a modest developmental defect of culmination during sorocarp development, as well as a reduction in sporulation efficiency. <br />DnmA is an active tRNA methyltransferase that modifies C38 in tRNAAsp(GUC) ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23877245 Muller, et al. 2013])Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 16-FEB-2005 PG
DDB_G0291982	Robert Dodson	The psi factor (prespore-inducing factor) is a secreted factor that has the ability to induce pre-spore cell differentiation under the appropriate conditions. The psi factor is a glycoprotein with an apparent molecular mass of 106 kDa, and with a predicted molecular mass of 60 kDA for the mature secreted protein. The ''psiA'' gene is maximally expressed at the loose mound stage. ''psiA'' knockout mutant strains develop normally; however, conditioned medium from these mutants shows reduced prespore-cell-inducing activity and reduced prespore cell division-inducing activity, suggesting that PsiA plays a role in the positive regulation of spore cell differentiation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15367206 Kawata et al. 2004]). The ''psiA'' gene is highly expressed in scattered cells at the mound stage and in prespore cells at the onset of culmination. During development, ''psiA'' overexpression delayed expression of the prestalk-specific gene ''ecmB'' ([/gene/DDB_G0269132 ecmB]), while ''ecmB'' was expressed precociously in ''psiA'' null cells. In addition, ''psiA'' overexpression inhibited DIF-1-induced stalk formation in monolayer cultures, indicating that PsiA is also involved in prestalk cell differentiation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20500764 Yamada et al. 2010]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-NOV-2020 RD
DDB_G0289881	Robert Dodson	The ''atg5'' gene was isolated among several members of the autophagy family of genes, conserved from yeast to man. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12626495 Otto et al. 2003)]. Macroautophagy is used by eukaryotic cells to recycle non-essential cellular components during starvation and development. ''atg5'' null mutants grow normally, but survival during nitrogen starvation is reduced and development of the mutant is severely impaired. On bacterial lawns ''atg5'' mutant cells do not aggregate, but form multi-tipped aggregates on filters ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12626495 Otto et al. 2003)]. The multi-tipped phenotype of ''atg5'' mutants is similar to that of mutants in other autophagy genes ''atg6'', ([/gene/DDB_G0269244 atg6A]) ''atg7'', ([/gene/DDB_G0271096 atg7]) ''atg101'', ([/gene/DDB_G0288287 atg101]) ''tipC'', ([/gene/DDB_G0267422 tipC]) and ''tipD'' ([/gene/DDB_G0275323 tipD]). Experiments with GFP-labelled autophagy proteins indicate that the atg5-atg12 ([/gene/DDB_G0282929 atg12]) conjugation system that has been described in yeast, is conserved in ''Dictyostelium'' [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12626495  (Otto et al., 2003)]. Axenically grown ''atg5'' null cells plated on filters form aberrant fruiting bodies which do not produce viable, detergent-resistent spores. Wild-type cells in a chimaera do not rescue the developmental defects, showing that the ''atg5'' mutation is autonomous ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12626495 Otto et al. 2003)]. Mutants lacking ''atg5'', ''atg7'' and ''atg9'' ([/gene/DDB_G0285323 atg9]) are impaired in cAMP induction of prespore gene expression, indicating that autophagy is required for this process ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31051160 Yamada et al. 2019)]. ''atg5'' single, ''atg5''/''atg12'' double, and ''atg5''/''atg12''/''tipD'' triple knockout mutants revealed similar defects in the conjugation of ATG8 to phosphatidylethanolamine, development, and cell viability indicating that Atg5, Atg12, and TipD act as a functional unit in canonical autophagy. However, distinct and sometimes opposite phenotypes in growth, macropinocytosis, phagocytosis, and proteasomal activity in these mutants reveal autophagy-independent functions for these genes, while providing further support that the ubiquitin proteasome system is dependent on intact autophagy for full activity.

DDB_G0277589	Petra Fey	''gtaC'' was identified as a DIF-1 insensitive mutant, dimC, that fail to make stalk cells in response to DIF in the 8-Br-cAMP monolayer assay. ''gtaC'' is expressed in the lower and upper cups and the basal disc;, and consistent with that pattern of expression, mutant phenotypes show that it is involved in DIF signaling leading to pstB cell sorting and basal disc formation.<br />''gtaC'' is maximally expressed during aggregation, and localizes to the nucleus upon DIF stimulation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22008230 Keller and Thompson 2008]). <br />GATA transcription factors specifically bind the DNA sequence (A/T)GATA(A/G) in the regulatory regions of genes ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2249770 Yamamoto et al. 1990]).In mammalian cells, GATA-binding transcription factors play important roles in development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12943715 Tremblay and Viger 2003]).

This behavior requires a negative regulation of an intrinsic nuclear localization signal and cAMP receptor-mediated phosphorylation of GtaC by [/gene/DDB_G0272110 gskA]. GtaC shuttling controls the proper expression of early development genes and inhibition of its nuclear exit leads to precocious gene expression and aberrant development. Consistent with the shuttling behavior, cAMP cycles generate bursts of GtaC-dependent transcription, indicating that GtaC is responsible for relaying oscillatory cAMP signaling ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24653039 Cai, et al. 2014]).

[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7565716  (Zhou et al. 1995)]<br />To investigate the minimal requirements for chemotaxis, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22081140  Kortholt et al. 2011] obtained quantitative data on Ras activation and chemotaxis in cAMP and folic acid gradients using a variety of Dictyostelium mutant cell lines from the four signaling pathways that contribute to chemotaxis: PI3K, TorC2, PLA2, and sGC. Their results demonstrate that Ras is activated at the leading edge, through a pathway consisting of G-alpha/beta/gamma, which does not depend on either of the four pathways. The authors measured chemotaxis of mutant cells exposed to cAMP gradients with different steepness and found that many mutants will chemotax in shallow gradients, despite a reduced sensitivity. Expression of multiple pathways increases sensitivity, with some combinations of pathways exhibiting weak amplification while others produce good chemotaxis with strong signal amplification. The results of cluster analysis revealed that one cluster of signaling pathways, including PI3K + TorC2 + sGC, is involved in inducing orientation of the cell towards the gradient, while a second cluster consists of cGMP + PLA2 and functions as a memory of current direction. Thus one individual pathway does not contribute strongly to chemotaxis, but it can synergize with other pathways, which together increases the sensitivity about 150-fold. These results suggest a conceptual model of chemotaxis in which a basal signaling module consisting of heterotrimeric and monomeric G proteins provides activation of Ras at the leading edge, which is sufficient for chemotaxis.Basic annotations have been added to this gene, 22-DEC-2014 RD
DDB_G0284977	Petra Fey	TSET is the latest addition to trafficking proteins, which is ancient but frequently lost or reduced in evolution. The TSET complex is a heterohexamer and was named for the protein subunits in the complex, TSPOON (sigma-like), TPLATE (beta-like), TCUP (mu-like), TSAUCER (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, zeta-like), TTRAY1, and TTRAY2. This ancient adaptor complex (AP) was identified in organisms such as Dictyostelids and land plants, such as ''Arabidopsis''. Only the TCUP subunit has been retained in fungi and animals, in mammals it has evolved into the cargo adaptor muniscin. A TSPOON-GFP fusion (gene tstD) has been shown to physically bind the 5 other TSET subunits. The TTRAY subunits form the scaffold for the TSPOON, TPLATE, TCUP, TSAUCER, heterotetramer. TIRF microscopy showed a punctate temporary localization of the complex to the plasma membrane. The TPLATE subunit contains armadillo-like helical domains [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24867644  (Hirst et al. 2014)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated,, 07-DEC-2018 PF
DDB_G0282459	Robert Dodson	Cells sense the chemorepellent AprA ([/gene/DDB_G0281663 aprA]) through the G-protein-coupled receptor GrlH. ''grlH'' null mutants are insensitive to the chemorepellent AprA and display phenotypes of rapid proliferation, insensitivity to AprA-induced proliferation inhibition and chemorepulsion, and reduced binding to AprA. AprA binds to the G-protein coupled receptor GrlH, and requires GrlH and the G protein Gbeta ([/gene/DDB_G0277143 gpbA]) to inhibit proliferation and induce chemorepulsion, and also uses the G protein Galpah8 ([/gene/DDB_G0284469 gpaH]) to inhibit proliferation. AprA requires GrlH to activate Ras proteins ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29440579 Tang et al. 2018]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30462573 Rijal et al. 2018]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 10-DEC-2018 RD
DDB_G0269154	Robert Dodson	N-linked high mannose oligosaccharides on glycoproteins are trimmed by alpha-glucosidase. A strain lacking alpha-glucosidase II was found to be missing a post-translational modification common to many lysosomal enzymes and the mutation was subsequently mapped to the ''modA'' locus on chromosome 1 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/57116  (Dimond and Loomis, 1976)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/96112  (Free et al. 1978)]. The activity of several lysosomal acid hydrolases is reduced in ''modA''- mutant strains. Failure to remove two alpha-1,3-linked glucose residues from the N-linked oligosaccharides delays intracellular transport of the hydrolases from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex and secretion from lysosomal compartments [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2505671  (Ebert et al. 1989)]. Loss of the enzyme also results in a block to addition of fucose to neutral N-glycans and a major reduction in addition of bisecting N-acetylglucosamine residues [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24574058  (Hykollari et al. 2014)]. The ''modA'' gene was cloned from a REMI mutant that makes short, thick stalks and was found to be highly similar to mammalian and yeast alpha-glucosidase II genes [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9397534  (Freeze et al. 1997)]. The original nitrosoguanidine induced mutation was the result of conversion of a G to an A in the codon at position 644 replacing glycine with aspartate.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 24-JAN-2019 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

DDB_G0293198	Robert Dodson	''kif10'' encodes a member of a family of kinesins with multiple functions [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14641909  (Kollmar and Glockner 2003)]. Cells lacking Kif10 grow normally and there are no obvious morphological defects in mitotic microtubule arrays but the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) appears slightly aberrant [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18430243  (Nag et al. 2008)]. Knocking out ''kif10'' suppresses the disruption of the interphase microtubule network and the formation of rockets that result from expression of a dominant-negative 380-kDa form of dynein ([/gene/DDB_G0276355 dhcA]). It appears that dynein and Kif10 cooperate in organizing the interphase microtubule distribution [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18430243  (Nag et al. 2008)]. mRNA levels for ''kif10'' are low during early development but then increase to relatively high levels between 12 and 18 hrs of development before returning to very low levels [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. This is the same pattern seen for the mRNAs encoding mitotic motor kinesins suggesting that Kif10 might also have a subtle role in mitosis.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 04-JUL-2017 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0276967	Robert Dodson	''racF2'' encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Rho family of small GTPases. G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Ras GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. GAPA ([/gene/DDB_G0269140 gapA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21085675 Mondal et al. 2010]) interacts with and is a possible GAP for RacF2.<br />RacF2 shares 94 percent sequence identity with another ''Dictyostelium'' Rho GTPase, RacF1 ([/gene/DDB_G0269176 racF1]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10198067 Rivero et al. 1999)]. ''racF2'' mRNA is expressed throughout the life cycle but is most highly expressed during sexual maturation with an almost 100-fold higher level of expression than during asexual development. Analysis of ''racF2'' null and overexpression mutants suggest that the gene affects sexual cell fusion and asexual development through the regulation of EDTA-sensitive cell-cell adhesion. RacF1 and RacF2 are likely to have redundant roles in sexual cell fusion ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16573737 Muramoto et al. 2006]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26940518 Rivero et al. 2016]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 20-MAY-2020 RD
DDB_G0280531	Robert Dodson	The mutated gene in one of the first REMI mutants was named ''lagC'' because morphogenesis stopped at the loose aggregate stage [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7926779  (Dynes et al. 1994)]. The gene encodes a secreted protein with a carboxy-terminal transmembrane domain that acts as an intercellular signal essential for post-aggregative gene expression [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7926779  (Dynes et al. 1994]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14651934  Kibler et al. 2003]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16386729  Iranfar et al. 2006)]. ''lagC'' was later found to be a member of a large family of highly similar genes and was renamed ''tgrC1'' (for Transmembrane, IPT, IG, E-set, Repeat protein); [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19285397  (Benabentos et al. 2009)]. <br />Antibodies to TgrC1 protein were found to recognize gp150, a characterized surface glycoprotein responsible for late EDTA-resistant cell-cell adhesion [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11071787  (Wang et al. 2000)]. Strains in which [/gene/DDB_G0289073 csaA], encoding the adhesion protein gp80, has been deleted, express TgrC1 precociously and retain EDTA-resistant adhesion; however, ''csaA-''/''tgrC1-'' double mutants do not develop EDTA-resistant cell adhesion demonstrating that TgrC1 is an adhesion protein. TgrC1 mediates cell-cell adhesion by heterophilic interaction with the related protein TgrB1 ([/gene/DDB_G0280689 tgrB1]); [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21700835  (Hirose et al. 2011]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23477311  Chen et al. 2013]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490801  Chen et al. 2014)]. Signal transduction from TgrB1/TgrC1 regulates expression of post-aggregative genes and thereby synchronizes temporal aspects of differentiation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16386729  (Iranfar et al. 2006]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21700835  Hirose et al. 2011)].<br />Independent isolates from nature show a high degree of polymorphism of TrgB1 and TgrC1. Cells with compatible TgrB1 / TgrC1 pairs form common aggregates but distant kin that express variants are excluded. This mechanism of kin recognition protects from potential cheaters that fail to make their fair share of stalk cells [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23910661  (Ho et al. 2013]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26018043  Ho and Shaulsky 2015)]. ''tgrB1'' and ''tgrC1'' are coordinately transcribed between 2 and 8 hours of development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. Transcriptome analysis of several ''tgrB1'' / ''tgrC1'' gene replacement strains revealed 68 differentially expressed genes at 8 hours and 85 genes at 12 hours development (only one gene differentially expressed at both time points). This underlines the necessity of allorecognition facilitating the transition to multicellularity during development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26395484  (Hirose et al. 2015)]. TgrB1/TgrC1 mediated development but not allorecognition is regulated by N-glycosylation through Alg9 ([/gene/DDB_G0279349 alg9]), a putative mannosyl transferase [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26359303  (Li et al. 2015)]. Cells lacking all three adenylate cyclase genes ([/gene/DDB_G0281545 acaA], [/gene/DDB_G0267376 acrA], [/gene/DDB_G0274569 acgA]) and overexpressing PKA ([/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC], [/gene/DDB_G0279413 pkaR]) exhibited cell polarization, tissue formation and cooperation when mixed with allotype-compatible wild-type cells, but not with incompatible ''tgrB1''-/''tgrC1''-/QS31 cells, indicating that TgrB1/TgrC1-mediated allorecognition and tissue formation do not require cAMP production as long as PKA is active (Hirose, et al 2021, PMID: 34169317).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 10-June-2016 PF; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0278009	Robert Dodson	''racN'' encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Rho family of small GTPases. G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Ras GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. A phylogenetic analysis reveals that RacI ([/gene/DDB_G0277897 racI]), RacM ([/gene/DDB_G0289103 racM]), RacN and RacO ([/gene/DDB_G0277791 racO]) cluster significantly together, suggesting that they might also function in the same processes ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16762450 Vlahou et al. 2006]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 09-JUN-2020 RD
DDB_G0269934	Robert Dodson	''rgbA'' encodes the large, multiple-domain protein RGBARG which contains RCC1, Rho GEF, BAR, and Ras GAP domains. RGBARB interacts with the Rho family small GTPases RacG ([/gene/DDB_G0269178 racG]) and RacH ([/gene/DDB_G0269240 racH]) suggesting that it may serve as a Rho GEF for these GTPases. In addition, the RGBARG RasGAP domain is active against numerous Ras family small GTPases. ''rgbA'' null cells display defects in macropinosome formation and phagocytosis, with a specific defect in phagocytosis of rod-shaped bacteria such as ''E. coli'' and ''M. smegmatis''. In ''rgbA'' null cells, Rac activity is not localized to the protrusive edge of macropinocytic cups as in wt cells. These results reveal that RGBARG integrates Ras and Rac signaling to allow efficient macropinosome formation and the engulfment of diverse bacteria of different geometry ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32531280 Buckley et al. 2020]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 18-JUN-2020 RD
DDB_G0282365	Robert Dodson	''rac1C'' encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Rho family of small GTPases. G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Ras GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. Rac GEF gxcT ([/gene/DDB_G0269610 gxcT]) interacts with and may also activate Rac1C ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24248334 Wang et al. 2013]). DGAP1 ([/gene/DDB_G0287585 rgaA]) and GAPA ([/gene/DDB_G0269140 gapA]) are possible GAPs for Rac1C ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10825297 Dumontier et al. 2000]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20375144 Lee et al. 2010]). Rac1C has multiple binding partners that may function as downstream effectors, including protein kinase PakA ([/gene/DDB_G0269166 pakA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15470506 Park et al. 2004]), myosin heavy chain kinase PakB ([/gene/DDB_G0276459 pakB]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15509655 de la Roche et al. 2005]) and protein kinase PakC ([/gene/DDB_G0267450 pakC]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15470506 Park et al. 2004]). Rac1C also binds to the Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 1 RhoGDI1 ([/gene/DDB_G0291077 rdiA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12163018 Imai et al. 2002]). ''rac1C'' is induced during sexual maturation but expression is reduced immediately after cell fusion, suggesting that Rac1C may be involved in cell/cell interactions during the sexual cycle ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16573737 Muramoto et al. 2005]). Expression of ''rasD'' is upregulated in response to intracellular ''Mycobacterium marinum'' infection ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31823727 Kjellin et al. 2019]). <br />''rac1C'' is highly similar to two additional ''Dictyostelium'' rho GTPases: ''rac1A'' ([/gene/DDB_G0277869 rac1A]) and ''rac1B'' ([/gene/DDB_G0268622 rac1B]). Expression of the three ''rac1'' genes is low during growth but increases 3-fold during aggregation before again declining to growth-stage levels during the slug stage ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8294042 Bush et al. 1993]). Overexpression of ''rac1'' genes results in increased filopodium formation, while constitutively active Rac1A and Rac1C mutants are severely impaired in growth, motility and endocytosis. In addition, these mutants are delayed in development and display defects in cytokinesis and F-actin organization. These results indicate that the Rac1 GTPases mediate signaling cascades regulating processes such as cell motility, endocytosis and cytokinesis that depend on the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in ''Dictyostelium'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10825297 Dumontier et al. 2000]). At the leading edge of migrating cells activated Rac1 participates in Scar/WAVE ([/gene/DDB_G0285253 scrA])-mediated actin polymerization and pseudopod extension. At the trailing edge activated Rac1 forms a complex with DGAP1 and the actin-binding proteins cortexillin I ([/gene/DDB_G0289483 ctxA]) and cortexillin II ([/gene/DDB_G0276893 ctxB]) enabling proper cell retraction ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20375144 Lee et al. 2010]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22891261 Veltman et al. 2012]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23503127 Faix et al. 2013]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26940518 Rivero et al. 2016]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 21-APR-2020 RD
DDB_G0283603	Robert Dodson	''rab32A'' (''rabE'') encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Rab family of small GTPases. G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rab GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Rab GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. Rab32A is similar to human RAB32 and human RAB38 which are involved in the regulation of phagosome maturation. Rab32A is also similar to ([/gene/DDB_G0269416 rab32B]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0275675 rab32C]). ''rab32A'' is expressed at very low levels during growth, but expression increases significantly after 8 hours of development, suggesting a role for ''rab32'' during development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10025509  (Norian et al. 1999)]. Proteomic analysis reveals that Rab32A is localized to phagocytic vesicles ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16926386 Gotthardt, et al. 2006]) lipid droplets ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24036346 Du, et al. 2013]) and also to the Legionella-containing vacuole [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28183814  (Schmolders et al. 2017)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 02-OCT-2020 RD
DDB_G0268760	Robert Dodson	''rabQ'' encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Rab family of small GTPases.

Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rab GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Rab GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. A genome-wide DNA microarray analysis revealed that ''rabQ'' expression is down-regulated during phagocytosis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18559084 Sillo, et al. 2008]), and a proteomic analysis revealed that RabQ is found in lipid droplets ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24036346 Du, et al. 2013]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 27-JAN-2021 RD
DDB_G0289541	Robert Dodson	VasP is an actin polymerase that belongs to a conserved family of actin regulatory proteins. VasP is directly involved in accelerating filament elongation by delivering monomeric actin to the growing barbed end [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18923426  (Breitsprecher et al. 2008)]. ''vasP'' transcripts are expressed in vegetatively growing cells and expression increases upon starvation, peaking at 8 hr., and then remains high until fruiting body formation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12388544  (Han et al. 2002)]. VasP localizes to the leading edge in migrating cells and to the tips of filopodia [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12388544  (Han et al. 2002)]. In addition, VasP localizes to macropinosomes, and in a narrow band at the advancing rim of the phagocytic cup (Korber, et al 2022, PMID:35101769).VasP interacts with Formin H ([/gene/DDB_G0285589 forH]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16675552  (Schirenbeck et al. 2006)], Profilin III ([/gene/DDB_G0271142 proC]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17467078  (Arasada et al. 2007)], and Scar/WAVE regulatory complex component AbiA ([/gene/DDB_G0267956 abiA]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28889942  (Litschko et al. 2017)]. In ''abiA'' null cells, VasP does not translocate to the leading edge, revealing that the recruitment of VasP to leading edge depends on AbiA [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28889942  (Litschko et al. 2017)]. VasP is phosphorylated in response to hyperosmotic stress and cAMP stimulation. VASP phosphorylation abolishes its interaction with WASP ([/gene/DDB_G0293834 wasA]) while phosphorylation contributes to its binding to WIPa ([/gene/DDB_G0270430 wipA]) with higher affinity. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20191567 (Lin et al. 2010)]. <br />VasP plays a role in controlling the actin cytoskeleton during chemotaxis, filopodium formation, macropinocytosis, and phagocytosis. ''vasP'' null mutants are unable to form filopodia and have aberrant actin filament formation with F-actin concentrated in a few small regions around the cell periphery. They also have defects adhering to the substratum and suppressing lateral pseudopod extension, resulting in a defect in chemotaxis to cAMP [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12388544  (Han et al. 2002)]. Myosin-I heavy chain MyoI ([/gene/DDB_G0274455 myoI]) fails to target efficiently to the cell cortex in ''vasP'' null cells. VasP produces a cortical actin network at the leading-edge cortex that activates MyoI, and together, VasP and MyoI drive filopodia initiation by further bundling and polymerizing actin. (Arthur, et al 2021, PMID: 34042588). Deletion of VasP results in substantial defects in both the macropinocytosis of bulk fluid and phagocytosis of yeast particles. There is a significant delay in the closure of the phagocytic cup during phagocytosis in ''vasP'' null cells. After cup closure, VASP localizes to the distal side of internalized phagosomes and initiates localized de-novo actin assembly to propel the phagosome deeper into the cell (Korber, et al 2022, PMID:35101769).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 10-FEB-2022 RD

DDB_G0271750	Robert Dodson	''nfaA'' encodes a Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP, rasGAP). RasGAPs are key components of signal transduction networks in which they inactivate Ras GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. ''nfaA'' null mutants are defective in chemotaxis to cAMP, and display reduced speed and directionality compared with wild-type (wt) cells. ''nfaA'' null mutants also display elevated basal levels as well as extended kinetics of cAMP-induced Ras activation compared to those of wt cells. The kinetics of activation of the Ras small GTPases RasG ([/gene/DDB_G0293434 rasG]) and RasB ([/gene/DDB_G0292998 rasB]) are delayed and extended in ''nfaA'' null mutants, indicating that NfaA has GAP activity towards both RasB and RasG. In chemotaxing ''nfaA'' null cells, Ras activity is also spatially mis-regulated resulting in multiple lamellipod-like extensions and no defined leading edge. Both phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate production and PKB ([/gene/DDB_G0268620 pkbA]) activation are delayed and prolonged in ''nfaA'' null cells. In addition, ''nfaA'' null cells also display random cell motility and cytokinesis defects, and F-actin polymerization is elevated in the mutants. Taken together, these results indicate that ''nfaA'' is involved in the regulation of chemotaxis to cAMP, PI3K signaling, and cytokinesis through the regulation of RasB and RasG activity ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18948008 Zhang et al. 2008]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 15-MAR-2022 RD
DDB_G0267674	Robert Dodson	The glycogen synthase encoded by the ''glcS'' gene is very similar to glycogen synthases in yeast and mammals and occurs in both G6P-dependent (D) and independent (I) forms [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9023987  (Williamson et al. 1996)]. It catalyzes the formation of alpha-1,4 glycosidic bonds, adding glucose monomers to growing chains of glycogen (starch). During growth and early development glycogen is the only polysaccharide present [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5530749  (Ashworth and Watts, 1970)]. The specific activity of glycogen synthase does not change significantly during development but the rate of glycogen synthesis increases during culmination when its substrate UDGP becomes less limiting [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6069170  (Wright and Dalhberg, 1967)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/988019  (Loomis and Thomas, 1976)]. Mutants lacking glycogen synthase had much less glycogen and had greatly delayed morphogenesis resulting in small fruiting bodies [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18424909  (Tresse et al. 2008)]. ''glcS'' null mutant stalk cells were encased in cellulose but had few large vacuoles.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 30-MAR-2017 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

DDB_G0267376	Robert Dodson	The ''acrA'' gene encodes the late developmental stage adenyl cyclase which is essential for spore encapsulation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10556070 Soderbom et al. 1999)]. This multi-domain protein contains a histidine kinase domain, two receiver domains, transmembrane helices and an adenyl cyclase domain. Mutation of ATP-binding residues in the histidine kinase domain does not affect adenyl cyclase activity, however, the dimerizing phosphoacceptor subdomain is essential for adenyl cyclase activity ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20966074 Chen et al. 2010)]. Low levels of adenyl cyclase activity independent of the aggregation stage adenyl cyclase ACA ([/gene/DDB_G0281545 acaA]) or germination stage adenyl cyclase ACG ([/gene/DDB_G0274569 acgA]), were observed in vegetative cells and referred to as ACB ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9812977 Kim et al. 1998)]. This activity was found to reach a maximum during early fruiting body formation just when ''acrA'' is maximally active ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10419694 Meima and Schaap, 1999)]. ''acrA'' was isolated from a REMI mutant that develops well up to the slug stage but makes fruiting bodies with long, thin stalks and very few viable spores ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10556070 Soderbom et al. 1999)]. During culmination cells synthesize and release the cytokinin, discadenine, that stimulates the accumulation of cAMP in a manner dependent on ''acrA'' and ''dhkB'' ([/gene/DDB_G0277845 dhkB]) but independent of ''rdeA'' ([/gene/DDB_G0282923 rdeA]) that encodes the small phosphorelay protein of two component systems ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18216168 Anjard and Loomis, 2008)]. It appears that cytokinins trigger autophosphorylation of the histidine kinase DhkB so that it can dimerize with AcrA and stimulate its activity. The resulting increase in cAMP and PKA ([/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC]), ([/gene/DDB_G0279413 pkaR]) activity induces the MADS-box transcription factor SrfA, ([/gene/DDB_G0281387 srfA]) essential for spore differentiation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12204259 Escalante and Sastre, 2002)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 28-APR-2016 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0287583	Robert Dodson	A family of nearly identical small proteins, GerA, GerB, and GerC, ([/gene/DDB_G0287293 gerA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0287687 gerB]) are coordinately synthesized during late culmination and again following the initiation of germination of spores [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2926809  (Giorda et al. 1989)]. Each of the proteins is 127 amino acids long and has a cannonical signal sequence at the N-terminus that could direct co-translational transport across membranes. No conserved domains are present that could give an indication of possible functions. The nucleotide sequences of the respective genes, ''gerA'', ''gerB'', and ''gerC'', are all very similar and are free of introns. These genes may result from recent duplications.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 10-OCT-2018 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0277041	Robert Dodson	''rheb'' encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases. G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs, rasGEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs, rasGAPs) inactivate Ras GTPases. Rheb is inactivated by the RasGAP ([/gene/DDB_G0280527 tsc2]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22266904 Rosel et al. 2012)]. <br />''rheb'' is expressed at all stages of development with expression localized largely in the prestalk/stalk region and also in the anterior-most prespore cells [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24499792  (Swer et al. 2014)]. ''rheb'' null cells exhibit an increased rate of phagocytosis. Expression of activated Rheb suppresses phagocytosis in wild-type and AKT null ([/gene/DDB_G0268620 pkbA]) cells, but it is unable to do so in either lst8 ([/gene/DDB_G0292592 lst8]) or rip3 null ([/gene/DDB_G0284611 ripA]) cells. Thus ''rheb'' GTPase regulates phagocytosis in a pathway that is independent of AKT, but integrated with TORC2. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22266904 Rosel et al. 2012)].

DDB_G0282893	Petra Fey	A comprehensive study classified all lysozymes in ''Dictyostelium''. In addition to the 5 known amoeba type lysozymes ([/gene/DDB_G0275123 alyA], [/gene/DDB_G0275119 alyB], [/gene/DDB_G0275121 alyC], [/gene/DDB_G0273197 alyD-1] and [/gene/DDB_G0286229 alyL] ), two new related lysozymes in this family have been identified, [/gene/DDB_G0282905 alyE] and [/gene/DDB_G0282893 alyF]. These genes are next to each other and almost identical, thus possibly a more recent gene duplication. In the past, gene models for these two new lysozymes gave rise to proteins with one or two transmembrane domains. Thus they first have been named alyTM1 and alyTM2, respectively. However, new sequence analyses resulted in updated gene models coding for proteins containing a signal peptide like the other 5 aly family members. Alignment of the 7 proteins allowed the identification of one conserved Asp and one Glu residue in the C- terminal portion of each protein, which might represent the amoeba lysozyme active site [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32061941 (Lamrabet et al. 2020)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 22-APR-2020 PF
DDB_G0279605	Robert Dodson	''racB'' encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Rho family of small GTPases. G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Ras GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. RacGEF1 ([/gene/DDB_G0277987 gxcA]) is a GEF for RacB ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15470506 Park et al. 2004]). Additional potential GEFs for racB include ''gflB'' ([/gene/DDB_G0286773 gflB]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27009206 Senoo et al. 2016]), DockC ([/gene/DDB_G0292004 docC]) and ZizA ([/gene/DDB_G0275035 zizA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22264729 Yan et al. 2012]). GAPA binds weakly to RacB and may function as a GAP for it ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26940518 Rivero et al. 2016]). <br />RacB has multiple binding partners that may function as downstream effectors. These include: protein kinases PakA ([/gene/DDB_G0269166 pakA]) and PakC ([/gene/DDB_G0267450 pakC]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15470506 Park et al. 2004]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15483055 Lee et al. 2004]), myosin heavy chain kinase PakB ([/gene/DDB_G0276459 pakB]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15509655 de la Roche et al. 2005]), WASP ([/gene/DDB_G0293834 wasA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16968699 Han et al. 2006]), WASP-B ([/gene/DDB_G0272811 wasB]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23791739 Chung et al. 2013]) and coronin A ([/gene/DDB_G0267382 corA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24347642 Swaminathan et al. 2013]). RacB also binds to the Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 1 RhoGDI1 ([/gene/DDB_G0291077 rdiA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12163018 Imai et al. 2002]). <br />''racB'' mRNA is expressed at a relatively constant level during the growth phase. Expression levels decrease significantly at the beginning of aggregation; approximately 10% of growth phase levels remained in cells late during development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8294042 Bush et al. 1993]). RacB is activated upon cAMP stimulation and activation is partially controlled by PI3K ([/gene/DDB_G0278727 pikA], [/gene/DDB_G0283081 pikB]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15470506 Park et al. 2004]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26940518 Rivero et al. 2016]). Constitutively active ''racB'' mutants have a flattened morphology and display increased F-actin polymerization and F-actin levels. The mutants also have defects in growth and cytokinesis and have dramatically reduced rates of endocytosis, phagocytosis, and endosomal efflux ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12796292 Lee et al. 2003]). ''racB'' null mutants have complementary phenotypes: decreased cAMP-stimulated F actin polymerization and F-actin levels, and decreased myosin II assembly. In addition, ''racB'' null mutants have a decreased chemotaxis rate and delayed aggregation. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15470506 Park et al. 2004]). These results reveal a role for ''racB'' in signaling networks regulating F-actin polymerization and chemotaxis. Through its interaction with the adaptor protein ElmoE, ([/gene/DDB_G0279657 elmoE]) RacB is involved in a protein complex and signaling pathway linking G-protein coupled receptors on the cell surface to the actin cytoskeleton. cAMP stimulated activation of cAR1 ([/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0273533 carA-2]) promotes the association between ElmoE, Gbeta ([/gene/DDB_G0277143 gpbA]) and Ggamma ([/gene/DDB_G0274125 gpgA]). ElmoE also interacts with Arp 2/3 components ArcB ([/gene/DDB_G0282813 arcB]), ArcC ([/gene/DDB_G0292804 arcC]), as well as actin ([/gene/DDB_G0275023 act22]). In addition, ElmoE associates with RacB and potential GEFs DocC ([/gene/DDB_G0292004 docC]) and (or) ZizA ([/gene/DDB_G0275035 zizA]) to form the evolutionarily conserved Elmo/Dock complex that likely serves as the GEF to activate RacB. Thus cAMP-stimulated activation of cAR1 results in ELMOE-mediated activation of RacB, which in turn promotes actin polymerization at the leading front of migrating cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22754623 Yan et al. 2012]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22754623 Yan et al. 2012]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28641070 Xu et al. 2017]).

DDB_G0289429	Petra Fey	NE81 (gene ''lmnB'') has been named for its nuclear envelope localization and has been shown to localize to the inner nuclear membrane during the entire cell cycle. The ''lmnB'' knockout and overexpression mutants revealed an important role in nuclear integrity, chromatin organization, and mechanical stability during shear stress. While GFP-NE81 does not exhibit considerable mobility at the nuclear envelope during interphase, as was expected for a structural component of a putative nuclear lamina, it is highly mobile between the onset of mitosis and early telophase. NE81 requires the prenylation signal as shown by deletion of the C-terminal CaaX box. In those cells, GFP-NE81 abolished localization of the protein to the nuclear envelope; instead, it resulted in clustering of the fusion protein inside the nucleus. During mitosis these clusters dissolve and become cellular. The protein has a conserved putative CDK1 ([/gene/DDB_G0272813 cdk1] phosphorylation site (S122). When this is mutated to alanine in the CaaX mutant, GFP-NE81 clusters do not dissolve during mitosis. This suggests regulation of lamin disassembly by CDK1 during mitosis. Also, GFP-NE81 and lamin B1 co-localize at the nuclear envelope in HeLa cells. These results are in agreement with the role a lamin plays in this organism and make NE81 the single lamin-like protein in Dictyostelium [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22090348  (Krueger et al. 2012]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22572958  Batsios et al., 2012)]. <br />Src1 ([/gene/DDB_G0293138 src1]) has been identified as a protein of the nuclear inner membrane and shown to bind directly to the lamin NE81 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26999214  (Batsios et al. 2016)]. Furthermore, lamin has been expressed lacking both the nuclear localization signal (NLS) and the CaaX box, resulting in a cytosolic protein that assembled in interphase and disassembled during mitosis mimicking the nuclear process. Expressing an additional phosphomimetic mutation (S122E) the same behavior was expected. However, image analysis showed that blue light induced cluster assembly, whereas green light and nearly ultra violet light did not induce assembly. Cell flattening under agarose also induced clustering. Both, blue light and cell flattening cause a lower pH, and when a lower pH was specifically tested, this also induced increased lamin assembly. While the effects were shown in a phosphomimetic mutant, these stress-induced assemblies likely also play a role in wild type lamin [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32759812  (Grafe et al. 2020)].

Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs, rasGEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs, rasGAPs) inactivate Ras GTPases. RasD is activated by the RasGEF E ([/gene/DDB_G0269252 gefE]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24282234 Chattwood et al. 2013)] RasD and GefE together regulate phototaxis, thermotaxis and cell lineage priming. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10837033 Wilkins et al. 2000)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16086850 Wilkins et al. 2005)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24282234 Chattwood et al. 2013)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30473004 Gruenheit et al. 2018)].<br />The ''rasD'' gene is inducible by cAMP. ''rasD'' mRNA accumulates to a low level during growth, is reduced during during early development and then re-accumulates during aggregation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1703508 Esch et al. 1991)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6091907 Reymond et al. 1984)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2644652 Robbins et al. 1989)]. Expression of ''rasD'' is upregulated in response to intracellular ''Mycobacterium marinum'' and ''Legionella pneumophila'' infection ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31823727 Kjellin et al. 2019]). During development ''rasD'' is first expressed during aggregation and by the time of slug development RasD expression is enriched in prestalk cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3749127 Reymond et al. 1986)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3443054 Jermyn et al. 1987)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3749127 Reymond et al. 1986)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7641977 Jermyn and Williams 1995)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1703508 Esch et al. 1991)]. RasD is capable of correcting some, but not all of ''rasG'' ([/gene/DDB_G0293434 rasG]) null phenotypes, suggesting some overlap in function between RasD and RasG ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10725225 Khosla et al. 2000)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20833893 Bolourani et al. 2010)]. <br />In constitutively active ''rasD'' mutants, cells aggregate into mounds with multiple tips, followed in most cases by developmental arrest. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3093890 Reymond et al. 1986)]. Additional phenotypes of constitutively active RasD mutants include enhanced expression of prestalk cell-specific genes, repressed expression of prespore cell-specific genes, and decreased Erk2 ([/gene/DDB_G0283903 erkB]) activation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9190209 Louis et al. 1997)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9020088 Aubry et al. 1997)]. ''rasD'' null mutants cells have no developmental defects, however they have significant defects in both phototaxis and thermotaxis, indicating that RasD plays a role in the regulation of both phototaxis and thermotaxis of multicellular slugs ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10837033 Wilkins et al. 2000)]. RasD interacts with several proteins to form a phototactic signaling complex: filamin ([/gene/DDB_G0269100 abpC]), ERK2, PKB ([/gene/DDB_G0268620 pkbA]) and a gelsolin-related protein ([/gene/DDB_G0291125 gnrA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16735078 Bandala-Sanchez et al. 2006)]. Ras signaling through RasD is also involved in cell fate bias. ''rasD'' null cells exhibit a spore bias in chimeric mixtures with wild type cells, while constitutively active ''rasD'' cells exhibit a strong stalk bias. A genetic screen for modulators of lineage bias identified GefE. Expression of GefE is required to activate RasD in a subset of cells, which in turn sets the intrinsic response threshold at which these cells respond to the pstB/pstO differentiation-inducer DIF, indicating that GefE acts through rasD to promote prestalk cell fate choice ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24282234 Chattwood et al. 2013)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30473004 Gruenheit et al. 2018)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 24-FEB-2020 RD

''Yersinia pestis'' survives and replicates intracellularly within ''D. discoideum'' within structures visually analogous to ''Yersinia''-containing vacuoles observed in infected mammalian macrophages. In macrophages, ''Y. pestis'' recruits host Rab1B protein to the phagosome, resulting in inhibition of phagosome acidification and disruption of the remaining phagolysosomal metabolic pathway, and suggesting a possible related role for ''rab1B'' in ''Dictyostelium'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29350155 Markman et al. 2018]).

[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7565716  (Zhou et al. 1995)]<br />To investigate the minimal requirements for chemotaxis, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22081140  Kortholt et al. 2011] obtained quantitative data on Ras activation and chemotaxis in cAMP and folic acid gradients using a variety of Dictyostelium mutant cell lines from the four signaling pathways that contribute to chemotaxis: PI3K, TorC2, PLA2, and sGC. Their results demonstrate that Ras is activated at the leading edge, through a pathway consisting of G-alpha/beta/gamma, which does not depend on either of the four pathways. The authors measured chemotaxis of mutant cells exposed to cAMP gradients with different steepness and found that many mutants will chemotax in shallow gradients, despite a reduced sensitivity. Expression of multiple pathways increases sensitivity, with some combinations of pathways exhibiting weak amplification while others produce good chemotaxis with strong signal amplification. The results of cluster analysis revealed that one cluster of signaling pathways, including PI3K + TorC2 + sGC, is involved in inducing orientation of the cell towards the gradient, while a second cluster consists of cGMP + PLA2 and functions as a memory of current direction. Thus one individual pathway does not contribute strongly to chemotaxis, but it can synergize with other pathways, which together increases the sensitivity about 150-fold. These results suggest a conceptual model of chemotaxis in which a basal signaling module consisting of heterotrimeric and monomeric G proteins provides activation of Ras at the leading edge, which is sufficient for chemotaxis.Basic annotations have been added to this gene, 13-MAR-2018 RD

DDB_G0279307	Robert Dodson	''Dictyostelium discoideum'' contains three highly similar vacuolin genes: ([/gene/DDB_G0289485 vacA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0279191 vacB]) and ''vacC''. They share a domain structure similar to metazoan flotillins, with a central PHB-like domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil region. Expression of ''vacC'' is upregulated in response to intracellular ''Mycobacterium marinum'' infection ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31823727 Kjellin et al. 2019]). All three vacuolins are tightly associated with membranes, and are recruited very early to phagosomes and steadily accumulate on post-lysososomes until exocytosis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9276759  (Rauchenberger et al. 1997]), [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16445684  (Peracino, et al. 2006]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32482795 Bosmani, et al. 2020]). <br />''vacC'' null mutants have a severe defect in phagocytosis, and a ''vacA''/''vacB''/''vacC'' triple null mutant revealed that the phagocytic defect results from impaired particle recognition. ''vacA''/''vacB''/''vacC'' mutants also have defects in plasma membrane protein recycling, decreased cell surface adhesion, and a more rapid phagosome maturation. In addition, ([/gene/DDB_G0274455 myoI]) (MyoVII) and ([/gene/DDB_G0290481 talA]) gene expression and protein levels are reduced in ''vacA''/''vacB''/''vacC'' mutants, and MyoVII expression rescues the adhesion, particle uptake and surface protein recycling phenotypes in these mutants. These results suggest that the absence of MyoVII and TalA are responsible for the uptake defects observed in vacuolin knockout mutants, and lead to the proposal that vacuolins stabilize the MyoVII/TalA complex formed at specific areas of the phagocytic cup and early endocytic compartments ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32482795 Bosmani, et al. 2020]).

DDB_G0291235	Robert Dodson	''ranA'' belongs to the Ras superfamily of small GTPases but is only distantly related to other Ras proteins within this superfamily. Ran family GTPases are GTP-binding proteins which regulate receptor-mediated transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm. They are required for the import of proteins into the nucleus and export of RNA from the nucleus. ''ranA'' is an ortholog of human RAN which encodes GTP-binding nuclear protein Ran and which is involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport. RanBP ([/gene/DDB_G0287391 ranbp1]) is an ortholog of human RANBP1 and likely serves as an effector protein contributing to the activation of RanA. Northern analysis indicates that ''ranA'' is expressed at relatively high levels during growth phase, but at significantly reduced levels late in development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8479927 Bush and Cardelli, 1993]). Tandem affinity purification identified an interaction between ranA and CP224 (cepJ) ([/gene/DDB_G0268616 cepJ]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15548420 Graf et al. 2004]) and proteomic analysis identified RanA as a component of the centrosome ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16512674 Reinders et al. 2006]), suggesting that RanA may play a role in cytokinesis. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25496424 Hilbi et al. 2014]). Proteomic analysis revealed that RanA is found in Legionella-containing vacuoles ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19482547 Shevchuk et al. 2009]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18980612 Urwyler et al. 2009]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24373249 Hoffmann et al. 2013]) and ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28183814 Schmolders et al. 2017]). Studies using human RAN in ''Dictyostelium'' cells reveal that RAN is activated by the ''Legionella pneumophila'' Icm/Dot substrate LegG1. Ran activation by LegG1 leads to microtubule stabilization and promotes intracellular pathogen vacuole motility and bacterial growth ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25496424 Hilbi et al. 2014]).

DDB_G0292004	Robert Dodson	''docC'' encodes a putative Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF, RhoGEF). RhoGEFs are key components of signaling networks in which they activate Rho family GTPases by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP. The adaptor protein ElmoE ([/gene/DDB_G0279657 elmoE]) associates with the Rho GTPase RacB ([/gene/DDB_G0279605 racB]) as well as with both DocC and ZizA ([/gene/DDB_G0275035 zizA]) suggesting that ElmoE, DocC, and ZizA may form an evolutionarily conserved Elmo/Dock complex to serve as a GEF for RacB ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22264729 Yan et al. 2012]). DocC localizes to mitochondria (MacWilliams and Hermann, unpublished observations). ''docC'' is threefold overexpressed in a strain lacking the retinoblastoma-like gene ''rblA'' ([/gene/DDB_G0290551 rblA]). ''docC'' is also strongly cell-cycle regulated, expressed in late G2 along with most DNA replication and mitotic genes. Taken together, these results suggest that ''docC'' may play a role in the cell cycle, possibly in cytokinesis (MacWilliams, unpublished observations).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 07-JUN-2021 RD
DDB_G0277913	Robert Dodson	''gefJ'' encodes a Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF, RasGEF). rasGEFs are key components of signaling networks in which they activate Ras family small GTPases by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP. ''gefJ'' is expressed during both growth and development. ''gefJ'' and ''gefI'' ([/gene/DDB_G0277915 gefI]) are highly similar, suggesting that they arose from a relatively recent gene duplication ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16086850 Wilkins et al. 2005)]. Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 13-APR-2021 RD
DDB_G0289665	Robert Dodson	''gefQ'' encodes a Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF, RasGEF). rasGEFs are key components of signaling networks in which they activate Ras family small GTPases by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP. ''gefQ'' is strongly expressed during both growth and development, with highest levels of expression at 8 and 12 hours of development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16086850 Wilkins et al. 2005)]. GefQ has GEF activity toward two small GTPases: RasB ([/gene/DDB_G0292998 rasB]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18504297 Mondal et al. 2008)] and Rap1 ([/gene/DDB_G0291237 rapA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25298405 Plak et al. 2014)]. GefQ has multiple binding partners: RasB, myosin heavy chain kinase A (MHCKA) ([/gene/DDB_G0291231 mhkA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18504297 Mondal et al. 2008)], and 14-3-3 protein ([/gene/DDB_G0269138 fttB]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818671 Li et al. 2020)]. &gt;). GefQ associates with F-actin, and is localized throughout the cytosol, enriched in the cell cortex and is also present in the nucleus ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18504297 Mondal et al. 2008)]. <br />GefQ is involved in the regulation of processes requiring myosin II, such as cytokinesis, cell motility, and suppression of lateral pseudopods. ''gefQ'' null mutants lack GEF activity towards RasB. In addition, ''gefQ'' null mutants have a decreased growth rate and developmental defects, including defects in cell sorting and slug migration during later stages of development. ''gefQ'' null mutants also have increased levels of unphosphorylated myosin II, resulting in myosin II over-assembly and the production of many random pseudopodia. ''gefQ'' overexpression activates RasB, causes enhanced recruitment of MHCKA to the cortex, and leads to cytokinesis defects in suspension. GefQ and constitutively active RasB directly interact with the myosin heavy chain kinase MHCKA to regulate myosin II assembly ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18504297 Mondal et al. 2008)]. ''gefQ'' null cells show reduced Rap1 activation at the poles of dividing cells, suggesting that GefQ is important for regulating Rap1 during cytokinesis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25298405 Plak et al. 2014)]. cAMP stimulates 14-3-3 protein binding to GefQ. Recombinant GefQ interacts with 14-3-3 after in vitro phosphorylation by PKA ([/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC], [/gene/DDB_G0279413 pkaR]) suggesting that PKA phosphorylates GefQ and promotes its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins in response to cAMP. ''gefQ'' mutant cells with an S431A point mutation are no longer able to bind 14-3-3, display a delay in development, and substantially lower ''rasB'' activation, suggesting that 14-3-3 binding to GefQ regulates development of ''Dictyostelium'' through RasB ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818671 Li et al. 2020)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 06-MAY-2021 RD
DDB_G0276019	Robert Dodson	''gefY'' encodes a Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF, RasGEF). rasGEFs are key components of signaling networks in which they activate Ras family small GTPases by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP.

In addition, a proteomic analysis revealed that GefY is enriched in the centrosome ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16512674 Reinders et al. 2006)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 28-MAY-2021 RD
DDB_G0277987	Robert Dodson	''gxcA'' encodes a Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF, RacGEF). RacGEFs are key components of signaling networks in which they activate Rho family GTPases by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP. GxcA (RacGEF1) is localized to the cell cortex in response to cAMP stimulation. In chemotaxing cells, GxcA is associated with the leading edge, and to a lesser extent with the trailing edge. GxcA has GEF activity toward the Rho GTPase RacB ''racB'' ([/gene/DDB_G0279605 racB]) and also has weak GEF activity towards Rac1B ([/gene/DDB_G0268622 rac1B]). ''gxcA'' null cells have a significant decrease in the activation of RacB, and also have an approximately 30% reduction in cAMP-mediated F-actin assembly. In ''gxcA'' null cells, development is delayed and cells overexpressing ''gxcA'' have more severe defects in development, indicating that ''gxcA'' also plays a role in development. These results indicate that GxcA directly activates RacB activity, and thereby regulates F-actin polymerization, and downstream chemotaxis and morphogenesis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15470506 Park et al. 2004]). GxcA interacts ''in vitro'' with the Ras GTPase RapA ([/gene/DDB_G0291237 rapA]) suggesting that GxcA may be a RapA effector and that RapA mediates F-actin polymerization through GxcA and RacB ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22644079 Mun et al. 2012]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 24-JUN-2021 RD

DDB_G0281663	Robert Dodson	The gene product encoded by [/gene/DDB_G0281663 aprA] is a secreted protein that exists in a 150 kDa protein complex. The AprA protein contains the PhoPQ-activated pathogenicity-related protein domain, which is thought to play a role in virulence of Salmonella. From its mutant phenotype,AprA functions in negative regulation of cell proliferation and is also clearly important for sporulation. Although it plays a role in cell proliferation, AprA does not have an effect on cell growth, as evidenced by an unchanged mass per number of cells in comparison to wild-type. Four proteins in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome are highly similar to AprA: [/gene/DDB_G0286625 DDB_G0286625], [/gene/DDB_G0277031 DDB_G0277031], [/gene/DDB_G0276897 DDB_G0276897], [/gene/DDB_G0282135 DDB_G0282135] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16176950 Brock and Gomer 2005]).<br />It has been demonstrated that Galpha8 (gene [/gene/DDB_G0284469 gpaH]) and Gbeta (gene [/gene/DDB_G0277143 gpbA]) are part of a signaling pathway used by AprA to inhibit cell proliferation but not growth, while Galpha9 (gene [/gene/DDB_G0283419 gpaI]) is part of a different pathway that regulates both proliferation and growth. Similar to aprA- and [/gene/DDB_G0281605 cfaD] null mutants, cells lacking these G-proteins proliferate faster than wild type ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19635129 Bakthavatsalam et al. 2009]).<br />In 2012 AprA has been found to also function as a chemorepellant. Wild-type cells at the edge of a colony showed directed movement outward from the colony, whereas cells lacking AprA did not. Starved cells are not repelled by recombinant AprA, suggesting that aggregation-phase cells are not sensitive to the chemorepellant effect. The secreted protein CfaD, the G protein Galpha8, and the kinase QkgA are necessary for the chemorepellant activity of AprA as well as its proliferation-inhibiting activity ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22711818 Philips et al. 2012]). The Retinoblastoma protein (gene [/gene/DDB_G0290551 rblA]) has been implicated in AprA function as recombinant AprA inhibits the proliferation of wild type cells, but not that of rblA- cells, and RblA is required for chemorepulsion ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24390142 Bakthavatsalam et al. 2014]).<br />([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29440579 Tang et al. 2018]) identified four mutants that show insensitivity to AprA: ([/gene/DDB_G0271686 grlB]), ([/gene/DDB_G0286895 grlD]), ([/gene/DDB_G0291356 grlE]), and ([/gene/DDB_G0282459 grlH]). Among these, cells lacking GrlH show most of the phenotypes expected for cells lacking the AprA receptor, including reduced binding to AprA, suggesting that GrlH is an AprA receptor. <br />The P21 activated protein kinase D (gene [/gene/DDB_G0269696 pakD]) was identified to being required for AprA dependent chemorepulsion ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24797076 Philips et al. 2014]). A comprehensive study comparing the pathways mediating AprA chemorepulsion to the cAMP chemoattraction pathways has delineated components of the AprA chemorepulsion pathway. Both cAMP chemotaxis and AprA chemorepulsion use G protein-coupled receptors, G proteins, and Ras, and both involve receptor-mediated activation of Ras. AprA uses a subset of chemoattraction signal transduction pathways including Ras, protein kinase A, TOR, phospholipase A, and ERK1, but does not require the PI3 kinase/Akt/PKB and guanylyl cyclase pathways to induce chemorepulsion. Genes involved in ArpA-mediated chemorepulsion include ([/gene/DDB_G0282459 grlH]), ([/gene/DDB_G0284469 gpaH]), ([/gene/DDB_G0277143 gpbA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0281385 rasC]), ([/gene/DDB_G0293434 rasG]), ([/gene/DDB_G0285161 dagA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC]), ([/gene/DDB_G0286557 pten]), ([/gene/DDB_G0277399 piaA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0292592 lst8]), ([/gene/DDB_G0292564 iplA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0278525 plaA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0288147 pkcA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0286353 erkA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0293526 racC]), ([/gene/DDB_G0285253 scrA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0269696 pakD]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0287969 cnrN]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30462573 Rijal et al. 2018]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 22-DEC-2014 PF
DDB_G0291768	Petra Fey	TSET is the latest addition to trafficking proteins, which is ancient but frequently lost or reduced in evolution. The TSET complex is a heterohexamer and was named for the protein subunits in the complex, TSPOON (sigma-like), TPLATE (beta-like), TCUP (mu-like), TSAUCER (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, zeta-like), TTRAY1, and TTRAY2. This ancient adaptor complex (AP) was identified in organisms such as Dictyostelids and land plants, such as ''Arabidopsis''. Only the TCUP subunit has been retained in fungi and animals, in mammals it has evolved into the cargo adaptor muniscin. A TSPOON-GFP fusion (gene tstD) has been shown to physically bind the 5 other TSET subunits. The TTRAY subunits form the scaffold for the TSPOON, TPLATE, TCUP, TSAUCER, heterotetramer. TIRF microscopy showed a punctate temporary localization of the complex to the plasma membran. The C-terminal domain of TCUP is homologous to the C-terminal domains of the muniscins, proteins in opisthokonts some of which are involved in the endocytic pathway [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24867644  (Hirst et al. 2014)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated,, 07-DEC-2018 PF

The ''tstD'' knockout has a slightly faster growth rate in HL5, but place size on a bacterial lawn is slightly decreased. Plasma membrane turnover is also slower than in will type. In sum, the phenotype of the deletion of TSPOON, the central small subunit, has only subtle phenotypes in ''Dictyostelium'' [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24867644  (Hirst et al. 2014)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated,, 06-DEC-2018 PF
DDB_G0279483	Robert Dodson	Phospholipase D hydrolyzes the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylcholine, producing choline and a phosphatidate. Three orthologs of mammalian phospholipase D1 (PLD1) are present in ''Dictyostelium'': ([/gene/DDB_G0281031 pldA]), ''pldB'' and ([/gene/DDB_G0277949 pldC]).<br />The ''pldB'' transcript first appears at the onset of development, peaking around 20 hr. Deletion of the ''pldB'' gene results in cells that are unable to sense cell density and aggregate at low cell concentrations. Conversely, cells over-expressing ''pldB'' do not aggregate, even at high cell densities. Additionally, ''pldB'' null cells develop precociously in submerged culture and on filter pads ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15821129 Chen et al. 2005]). PldB regulates chemotaxis and cell sorting, and was also found to mediate CMF-dependent quorum sensing by regulating G protein signaling ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20950684 Ray et al. 2011]). PldB and ([/gene/DDB_G0274109 paxB]) functionally interact to regulate the organization of the actin cytoskeleton ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21531871 Pribic et al. 2011]). The protein kinase ''pkcA'' ([/gene/DDB_G0288147 pkcA]) positively regulates phospholipase D activity, and PkcA and PldB functionally interact to regulate aggregation, differentiation, and cell-cell adhesion during development.

DDB_G0292804	Robert Dodson	''arcC'' encodes the 21 kDa subunit of the Arp2/3 complex [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11807934  (Insall et al. 2001)]. The seven subunits of this 200 kDa complex are encoded by ([/gene/DDB_G0277825 arcA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0282813 arcB]), ''arcC'', ([/gene/DDB_G0269102 arcD]), ([/gene/DDB_G0288319 arcE]), ([/gene/DDB_G0272106 arpB]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0283755 arpC]). The subunits of mammalian Arp2/3 are very similar to ''Dictyostelium'' homologs. Arp2/3 binds to the side of F-actin filaments and initiates polymerization of a new F-actin chain at an angle of 70 degrees leading to a branched actin network that can alter the shape of cells. The ability to nucleate new actin filaments is greatly stimulated by direct interactions with members of the WASP/SCAR family [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11807934  (Insall et al. 2001)]. The Arp2/3 complex largely mediates the actin polymerization response to chemotactic stimulation and contributes to cell motility, pseudopod extension and adhesion in Dictyostelium chemotaxis. The complete Arp2/3 complex is essential for growth; partial loss of activity of either ArcB or ArpB impairs growth and chemotaxis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17553489  (Langridge and Kay, 2007)]. mRNA from each of the genes encoding Arp2/3 subunits accumulates coordinately to reach a peak at 3 hours of development and gradually decreases thereafter [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. The Arp2/3 complex interacts with the protein CARMIL, which serves as a scaffold for the assembly of a larger complex of proteins involved in the nucleation and termination of actin filament assembly. The complex consists of CARMIL ([/gene/DDB_G0292386 carmil]), AcpA, ([/gene/DDB_G0267374 acpA]) AcpB, ([/gene/DDB_G0272104 acpB]) the Arp2/3 complex, and type I myosins MyoB ([/gene/DDB_G0289117 myoB]) and MyoC ([/gene/DDB_G0276617 myoC]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11425877  (Jung et al. 2001)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 23-MAY-2019 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

DDB_G0267446	Robert Dodson	The regulatory subunit of calcineurin is encoded by ''cnbA''. The primary sequence of this calcium/calmodulin dependent protein phosphatase is very similar to the sequences of calcineurin B in mammals that all have two calcium binding EF hands [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11352578  (Aichem and Mutzell, et al. 2001)]. In the absence of calcium, calcineurin A ([/gene/DDB_G0276883 canA]) and calcneurin B form inactive heterodimers that are converted to active heterotetramers when they bind Ca++/calmodulin [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25518940  (Sugden et al. 2014)]. RNA-seq studies have shown that canA and cnbA are coordinately expressed during early aggregation and reach a peak at 11 hrs of development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. Inhibition of calcineurin activity with the polyphenolic aldehyde, gossypol, reduces the rate of growth and the number of aggregates formed after 24 hrs of development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15621416  (Weissenmayer et al. 2005)]. cAMP relay is inhibited within 10 minutes of addition of 10 microM gossypol. Gossypol also stimulates nuclear translocation of the prestalk transcription factor DimB ([/gene/DDB_G0291372 dimB]) within a few minutes and blocks nuclear translocation of the transcription factor TacA ([/gene/DDB_G0291342 tacA]) in response to calcium indicating that calcineurin mediates these responses [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22944283  (Thewes et al. 2012)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25518940  (Sugden et al. 2014)]. Cells lacking calcineurin as the result of expression of RNAi for either canA or cnbA form a reduced number of fruiting bodies with short stalks [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16512895  (Boeckeler et al. 2006)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23686520  (Thewes et al. 2013)] These mutant strains are also hypersensitive to high levels of cations showing that calcineurin is responsible for stress responses as in other organisms.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 16-APR-2018 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

Rab11C localizes to the contractile vacuole suggesting that it is a regulator of the contractile vacuole; however, overexpression of Rab11C only partially suppresses the large vacuole phenotype in disgorgin null cells (unpublished data) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18636095 Du, et al. 2008]). Proteomic analysis reveals that Rab11C is also located the Legionella-containing vacuole ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28183814  (Schmolders et al. 2017]), and ''M. marinum''-containing vacuoles (PMID:33531393; Hanna, ''et al.'' 2021).

DDB_G0291293	Robert Dodson	''rabU'' encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Rab family of small GTPases. G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rab GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Rab GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP.Basic annotations have been added to this gene, 10-FEB-2021 RD

DDB_G0282373	Robert Dodson	''gbpD'' (''gefU'') encodes a 144 kDa protein that has a conserved RasGEF domain near the N-terminus followed by a cyclic nucleotide binding domain that has lost affinity to cyclic nucleotides [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12011437  (Goldberg et al. 2002)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12952076  (Bosgraaf et al. 2002)]. The domain arrangement is similar to that in the second half of GbpC ([/gene/DDB_G0291079 gbpC]). ''gbpD'' is expressed throughout growth and development, with highest levels of expression between 8 and 12 hours of development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16086850 Wilkins et al. 2005)]. The phenotype of mutants that have lost GbpD is almost opposite that of mutants that have lost GbpC; ''gbpD'' null mutants are hyperpolarized, make few lateral pseudopods and have improved chemotaxis. Overexpression of ''gbpD'' results in cells that are unable to polarize, extend many lateral pseudopodia and are greatly impaired in chemotaxis to cAMP, much like gbpC null mutants, suggesting that overexpressed GbpD might block the function of GbpC [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15827084  (Bosgraaf et al. 2005)]. Consistent with this interaction, the phenotype of double mutants lacking both GbpC and GbpD is indistinguishable from that of cells lacking only GbpC [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12952076  (Bosgraaf et al. 2002)]. Moreover, GbpD is an exchange factor for the small GTPase Rap1 ([/gene/DDB_G0291237 rapA]) which binds to the Ras-binding domain of PI3K ([/gene/DDB_G0278727 pikA], [/gene/DDB_G0283081 pikB], and [/gene/DDB_G0275011 pikC]) and stimulates its activity [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16769729  (Kortholt et al. 2006)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20089846  (Kortholt et al. 2010)]. Rap1-GTP is found preferentially at the leading edge of cells migrating chemotactically. Cells overexpressing GbpD have high levels of PIP3 in the membrane resulting in the formation of multiple lateral pseudopods and increased cell-substratum adhesion. However, overexpression of GbpD in pikA/pikB null cells does not induce the cell-substratum adhesion or multiple lateral pseudopods phenotypes, indicating that a GbpD/RapA/PI3K pathway helps control pseudopod formation and cell polarity.

DDB_G0284725	Robert Dodson	''docD'' encodes a putative Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF, RhoGEF). RhoGEFs are key components of signaling networks in which they activate Rho family GTPases by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP. ''docD'' is expressed at all stages of development through early culmination (unpublished observations, cited in Para, 2009). In response to cAMP, DocD rapidly translocates to the cell cortex, and in chemotaxing cells, DockD preferentially localizes to the leading edge. Translocation is impaired in (PI3K) ([/gene/DDB_G0278727 pikA], [/gene/DDB_G0283081 pikB]) double null mutants, indicating that localization is dependent on localized production of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate. DocD forms a stable complex with the adaptor protein Elmo1 ([/gene/DDB_G0278051 elmoA]) in both vegetative and aggregation-competent ''Dictyostelium'' cells, either before or after chemoattractant stimulation. In addition, the DocD-ElmoA complex associates with the Rho small GTPases: Rac1A ([/gene/DDB_G0277869 rac1A]) and RacC ([/gene/DDB_G0293526 racC]) suggesting that DocD is a GEF for Rac1A and RacC. <br />''docD'' null mutant cells exhibit no growth or developmental defects. However, developmentally competent ''docD'' null mutants chemotax with moderately reduced speed and polarity in a cAMP gradient. The chemotaxis defect is more pronounced in ''docA''/''docD'' ([/gene/DDB_G0291974 docA]) double null mutant cells which have a further reduction in speed and polarity. Vegetative stage ''docD'' null mutants show a significant decrease in random motility, and the cell motility defect is no worse in the ''docA''/''docD'' double null mutant. However, expression of either DocA or DocD in the double null mutant rescues the phenotype, suggesting that DocA and DocD may function redundantly. Loss of DocA and DocD also affects the distribution of F-actin polymerization, as the vegetative double null cells appeared incapable of localizing F-actin accumulation at restricted regions of the cortex to create effective membrane protrusions. Vegetative stage cells over-expressing DocD have opposing phenotypes; they have increased cell motility, an increase in pseudopod formation and increased levels of F-actin polymerization compared with wild-type cells. Taken together, these results indicate that DocA and DocD regulate the actin cytoskeleton and cell motility ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19037099 Para et al. 2009]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 04-JUN-2021 RD
DDB_G0291079	Robert Dodson	''gbpC'' (''gefT'') encodes a large multi-domain, high affinity cGMP-binding protein. There is a leucine rich repeat (LRR) at the N-terminus followed by a Ras-related domain and a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) domain; these domains are followed by a RasGEF domain, and two cyclic nucleotide binding domains with a GRAM domain in between [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12011437  (Goldberg et al. 2002)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12952076  (Bosgraaf et al. 2002)]. ''gbpC'' is expressed throughout growth and development, with highest levels of expression between 4 and 12 hours of development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16086850 Wilkins et al. 2005)]. GbpC is a founding member of the Roco family of proteins (Ras of complex proteins) which includes human leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) that can cause late-onset Parkinson's disease [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14654223  (Bosgraaf and van Haastert 2003)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24981771  (Civiero et al. 2014)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24847205  (Gilsbach and Kortholt 2014)]. ''gbpC'' may have resulted from the fusion of two independent genes, one encoding Ras-MAPKKK and one related to GbpD ([/gene/DDB_G0282373 gbpD]) containing a RasGEF domain and an ancient cAMP-binding (cNB) motif. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12615006  (Roelof et al. 2003)]. Mutants lacking GbpC have lost all high affinity cGMP binding activity, are unable to polarize, and are greatly impaired in chemotaxis to cAMP gradients [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15827084  (Bosgraaf et al. 2005)]. In wild type cells, cAMP induces rapid phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain (RLC) ([/gene/DDB_G0276077 mlcR]) by a cGMP-dependent pathway, however, cAMP induces significantly less phosphorylation of RLC in ''gbpC'' null cells, confirming the role of cGMP in myosin II regulation. When cGMP binds to GbpC, it initiates an intramolecular signaling cascade in which the RasGEF activates Ras which stimulates the protein kinase activity [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18703517  (van Egmond et al. 2008)]. The MAPKKK may then initiate a protein kinase cascade activating the myosin light chain protein kinase MLCK-A ([/gene/DDB_G0279925 mlkA]) that phosphorylates RLC to promote myosin motor activity [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16814425  (Bosgraaf and van Haastert 2006)]. cGMP bound GbpC also leads to actin polymerization [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24136144  (Pfannes et al. 2013)]. Independently of cGMP signaling, cAMP stimulation results in rapid translocation of GbpC from the cytoplasm to the cell perimeter where it may locally phosphorylate effector proteins. The GRAM domain of GbpC is required for membrane association and its function in chemotaxis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22119747  (Kortholt et al. 2011)]. When developed on filters, ''gbpC''- mutant cells can aggregate slowly by accretion resulting in the delayed formation of mounds which then develop normally.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 08-JUN-2021 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0270306	Robert Dodson	A comparative phylogenetics analysis of ''cudA''-like genes ([/gene/DDB_G0284465 cudA]) in Dictyostelia revealed that two paralogous genes: ([/gene/DDB_G0286351 cdl1A]) and ''cdl1B'' result from duplication of an ancestral ''cdl1'' gene. Expression of ''cdl1A'' and ''cdl1B'' is upregulated at 16 hours when migrating slugs have formed, with highest expression of both genes in pre-stalk cells. ''cdl1A''/''cdl1B'' double null mutants develop normally until culmination, but then show severe defects in stalk formation. The cellulose stalk tube formed but with a disorganized arrangement of stalk cells inside the tubes, indicating that Cdl1a and Cdl1b are both required for proper stalk morphogenesis. Deletion of ''cdl1'' in an outgroup species, ''Polysphondylium violaceum'' also caused defects in stalk morphogenesis, suggesting that the ancestral function of ''cdl1'' in the Dictyostelia was stalk formation (Kin, et al. 2021, PMID:34883046).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 20-DEC-2021 RD

An analysis of ''Dictyostelium'' ras family genes reveals that ''rasU'', ''rasV'' ([/gene/DDB_G0270736 rasV]), ''rasW'' ([/gene/DDB_G0270122 rasW]), ''rasX'' ([/gene/DDB_G0270124 rasX]), ''rasY'' ([/gene/DDB_G0270126 rasY]) and ''rasZ'' ([/gene/DDB_G0270140 rasZ]) form a separate phylogenetic clade ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29614268 Park et al. 2018]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 16-MAR-2020 RD
DDB_G0275119	Petra Fey	AlyB has been identified in a search of ''Dictyostelium'' sequences similar to [/gene/DDB_G0275123 alyA], which has been shown to have lysozyme activity. ''alyA'', ''alyB'', and [/gene/DDB_G0275121 alyC] encode nearly identical proteins; there are also two more distantly related genes: ''alyD'', (present in two copies chromosome 2: [/gene/DDB_G0273197 alyD-1], [/gene/DDB_G0273731 alyD-2]) and [/gene/DDB_G0286229 alyL]. These aly enzymes are not similar to any other known lysozymes. It has been suggested that these proteins represent a new class of lysozymes [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15640146  (Mueller et al., 2005)].<br />A comprehensive study classified all lysozymes in ''Dictyostelium''. In addition to the 5 known amoeba like lysozymes ([/gene/DDB_G0275123 alyA], [/gene/DDB_G0275119 alyB], [/gene/DDB_G0275121 alyC], [/gene/DDB_G0273197 alyD-1] and [/gene/DDB_G0286229 alyL] ), two new related lysozymes in this family have been identified, [/gene/DDB_G0282905 alyE] and [/gene/DDB_G0282893 alyF]. Because in the past, gene models for these two new lysozymes gave rise to proteins with transmembrane domains, one or two respectively, they first have been named alyTM1 and alyTM2. However, new sequence analyses resulted in updated gene models coding for proteins containing signal peptides like the other 5 members of the aly family. Alignment of the 7 proteins allowed the identification of one conserved Asp and one Glu residue in the C- terminal portion [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32061941 (Lamrabet et al. 2020)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 29-APR-2020 PF

DDB_G0269178	Robert Dodson	''racG'' encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Rho family of small GTPases. G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Ras GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. Possible GEFs for RacG include RGBARG ([/gene/DDB_G0269934 rgbA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32531280 Buckley et al. 2020]), GxcC ([/gene/DDB_G0284845 gxcC]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23363311 Plak et al. 2013]) and ZizB ([/gene/DDB_G0293084 zizB]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22366457 Pakes et al. 2012]). <br />''racG'' mRNA is expressed at almost the same level from the vegetative to the slug stage, but expression gradually decreases after culmination ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11201251 Okuwa et al. 2001]). ''racG'' is also induced during sexual maturation but expression is reduced immediately after cell fusion, suggesting that RacG may be involved in cell/cell interactions during the sexual cycle ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16573737 Muramoto et al. 2006]). RacG participates in signaling pathways that regulate processes dependent on rearrangement of the cytoskeleton such as cell morphology, phagocytosis, and chemotaxis. RacG is targeted to the plasma membrane and localizes in the cell cortex, filipodia, and transiently to phagocytic cups. Overexpression of RacG stimulates phagocytosis and promotes formation of excess filipodia, resulting in a spiky morphology. ''racG'' null mutants have a mild defect in chemotaxis to cAMP, but growth, pinocytosis, exocytosis, development and cytokinesis were unaffected in the absence of ''racG''. In a cell-free system, RacG stimulates actin polymerization through the Arp2/3 complex. Cells overexpressing RacG have decreased levels of activated Rac1 ([/gene/DDB_G0277869 rac1A], [/gene/DDB_G0268622 rac1B], [/gene/DDB_G0282365 rac1C]), suggesting that the defects observed in this strain may be due to impaired Rac1 activation and interference with signaling through other Rho GTPases such as RacB ([/gene/DDB_G0279605 racB]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16950926 Somesh et al. 2006]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26940518 Rivero et al. 2016]).

DDB_G0292564	Robert Dodson	The [/gene/DDB_G0292564 iplA] gene encodes a protein predicted to have inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptor activity by similarity to the human INSP3 receptor. The ''iplA'' transcript is expressed at low levels during growth and peaks at 9 h before declining. A null mutant of ''iplA'' lacks cAMP-stimulated Ca2+ uptake, however, its ability to chemotax towards cAMP is uninhibited ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10970875 Traynor et al. 2000]). Further analysis of ''iplA-'' cells by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15760480 Schaloske and colleagues (2005)] shows that while influx of extracellular Ca2+ is largely reduced, release of stored Ca2+ into the cytoplasm is intact. Inhibition of capacitative Ca2+ entry does in fact impair the ability of cells to chemotax towards cAMP.<br />Lam ''et al.'' showed that mutation of the ''iplA'' gene inhibited autophagic cell death, suggesting that Ca2+ flux is necessary to signal this cell death. In addition, ''iplA''/[/gene/DDB_G0292390 atg1] double null cells showed a variable and partial inhibition of necrotic cell death, suggesting a lesser role for iplA in this form of cell death ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18077554 Lam et al. 2008]).<br />([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22375061 Lusche et al. 2012]) found that IplA localized to cytoplasmic vesicular membranes and to a lesser extent to the plasma membrane. ''iplA'' null cells exhibit defects in Ca2+ mediated chemotaxis, and lack the capacity to reorient in the direction of the aggregation center at the onset of cAMP waves. These results suggest that IplA is either the Ca2+ chemotaxis receptor or an essential component of the Ca2+ chemotaxis regulatory pathway.<br />Two basic modes of calcium signaling can be distinguished in ''Dictyostelium'': GPCR-dependent signaling (cAMP and folic acid) whose onset is delayed for 5-10 s after the stimulus, and which depends on IplA; and purinergic signalling (ATP and ADP) which has a rapid onset of less than 1 s, is independent of G-beta ([/gene/DDB_G0277143 gpbA]) and IplA, but depends on TrpP ([/gene/DDB_G0272999 pkd2]). ''iplA'' is also required for response to DIF and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28011630 Traynor et al. 2017]). ''iplA'' is involved in the signal transduction pathway responsible for AprA-dependent ([/gene/DDB_G0281663 aprA]) chemorepulsion ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30462573 Rijal et al. 2018]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 5-MAY-2008 PF

DDB_G0289485	Robert Dodson	''Dictyostelium discoideum'' contains three highly similar vacuolin genes: ''vacA'', ([/gene/DDB_G0279191 vacB]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0279307 vacC]). They share a domain structure similar to metazoan flotillins, with a central PHB-like domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil region. ''vacA'' mRNA is expressed in growing cells, transiently increases in early starvation and remains detectable throughout development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9394012  (Jenne et al. 1998)]. Expression of ''vacA'' is upregulated in response to intracellular ''Mycobacterium marinum'' and ''Legionella pneumophila'' infection ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31823727 Kjellin et al. 2019]) and VacA is associated with ''M. marinum''-containing compartments ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25779329 Barisch, et al. 2015]). All three vacuolins are tightly associated with membranes, and are recruited very early to phagosomes and steadily accumulate on post-lysososomes until exocytosis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9276759  (Rauchenberger et al. 1997]), [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16445684  (Peracino, et al. 2006]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32482795 Bosmani, et al. 2020]). The distribution of VacA is altered in ''racH'' ([/gene/DDB_G0269240 racH]) null mutants ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17004322 Somesh, et al. 2006]). <br />Vacuolins play a role in endocytosis. ''vacA'' null mutants have a severe defect in phagocytosis, and a ''vacA''/''vacB''/''vacC'' triple null mutant revealed that the phagocytic defect results from impaired particle recognition. ''vacA''/''vacB''/''vacC'' mutants also have defects in plasma membrane protein recycling, decreased cell surface adhesion, and a more rapid phagosome maturation. In addition, ([/gene/DDB_G0274455 myoI]) (MyoVII) and ([/gene/DDB_G0290481 talA]) gene expression and protein levels are reduced in ''vacA''/''vacB''/''vacC'' mutants, and MyoVII expression rescues the adhesion, particle uptake and surface protein recycling phenotypes in these mutants. These results suggest that the absence of MyoVII and TalA are responsible for the uptake defects observed in vacuolin knockout mutants, and lead to the proposal that vacuolins stabilize the MyoVII/TalA complex formed at specific areas of the phagocytic cup and early endocytic compartments ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32482795 Bosmani, et al. 2020]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated 28-OCT-2020 RD
DDB_G0281239	Robert Dodson	''impa1'' encodes inositol monophosphatase (IMPase), an enzyme of broad specificity which is inhibited by lithium and is involved in myo-inositol biosynthesis. IMPase dephosphorylates inositol phosphate to generate inositol, which may then be recycled into inositol lipids. ''impa1'' also plays a role in intracellular phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) trisphosphate (PIP3) signaling. Lithium suppresses PIP3 signaling in both ''Dictyostelium'' and cultured human neutrophil cells, by suppressing synthesis of the phosphoinositide precursors of PIP3. Increased expression of IMPase reverses the effects of lithium, suggesting that lithium acts through inositol depletion. In the absence of lithium, elevated IMPase leads to elevated PIP3 signaling [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19383941  (King et al. 2009)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 09-OCT-2020 RD

Rab8A interacts with the exocyst complex subunit protein Exoc6 (Sec15) ([/gene/DDB_G0293936 exoc6]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22323285  (Essid et al. 2012)]. ''rab8A'' is expressed during growth and throughout development with maximum expression at 15 hours ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2109188 Saxe et al. 1990]). Rab8A localizes to the contractile vacuole membrane ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18636095 Du et al. 2008]), [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22323285  (Essid et al. 2012)], and proteomic analysis reveals that Rab8A also localizes to the Legionella-containing vacuole ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18980612 Urwyler et al. 2009]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24373249 Hoffmann et al. 2013]), [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28183814  (Schmolders et al. 2017)]. <br />Rab8a regulates the exocyst-mediated discharge of the contractile vacuole. Constitutively active ''rab8A'' contains smaller contractile vacuoles compared with wt, while dominant-negative ''rab8A'' cells contain an increased number of larger contractile vacuoles. Rab8A interacts with the exocyst complex subunit protein Exoc6, and in dominant-negative ''rab8A'' cells, the localization of Exoc6 to the contractile vacuole (CV) bladder is abolished. Rab8A is recruited to the CV by drainin ([/gene/DDB_G0269130 phgA]), and CV-associated Rab8a is activated by a GEF activity associated with the exocyst complex that acts at the time of its recruitment onto the CV bladder. Rab8A regulates contractile vacuole to plasma membrane tethering via the exocyst complex which is then followed by the discharge of water out of the cell. The RabGAP activity of disgorgin then inactivates rab8A, leading to dissociation of the Rab8a-GDP exocyst complex from the CV bladder membrane ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18636095 Du, et al. 2008]), [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22323285  (Essid et al. 2012)]. In addition, constitutively active and dominant-negative ''rab8A'' mutants have defects in actin cytoskeleton organization, development, secretion and cell-cell adhesion ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15289548 Powell et al. 2004]).

DDB_G0288065	Robert Dodson	CdcD is a member of the triple A ATPase family and is the ortholog of human VCP (p97), mutations in which cause autosomal-dominant IBMPFD (inclusion body myopathy with early onset Paget's disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia). Overexpression of wild type or mutant ''cdcD'' in both AX2 and ''atg9'' ([/gene/DDB_G0285323 atg9]) null cells results in defects in growth, phototaxis, development, proteasomal activity, and ubiquitinylated proteins, indicating misregulation of multiple essential cellular processes. Expression of wild type ''cdcD'' in ''atg9'' null cells results in aberrant fruiting body morphology, however the expression of ''cdcD''(R155C/E219K) in the ''atg9'' null strain rescued this defect ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23056506 Arhzaouy et al. 2012)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29912958 Arhzaouy et al. 2018)]. CdcD has ATPase activity which is abolished in a ''cdcD''(E219K) mutant. CdcD binds to the UBX domain-containing protein 9 (UBXD9) ([/gene/DDB_G0279285 DDB_G0279285]). CdcD is found in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and the presence of UBXD9 causes an increased enrichment of CdcD in the nucleus ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27132113 Rijal et al. 2016)]. CdcD expression is dependent on both the kinase and the RNase activities of IreA ([/gene/DDB_G0267650 ireA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29632077 Ongay-Larios et al. 2018)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 08-JAN-2021 RD

Expression of ''gefO'' during growth and development is hardly detectable with the highest, but still weak, level of ''gefO'' expression at 12 hours of development. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that ''gefO'', ''gefF'' ([/gene/DDB_G0293006 gefF]), and ''gefH'' ([/gene/DDB_G0276963 gefH]) are the least similar to other RasGEFs in ''Dictyostelium'' and other organisms ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16086850 Wilkins et al. 2005)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 30-APR-2021 RD

DDB_G0281823	Petra Fey	 Gene ''tpp1F'' is a member of a ''Dictysotelium'' family of tripeptidyl-peptidase 1 encoding genes ([/gene/DDB_G0269914 tpp1], [/gene/DDB_G0290333 tpp1B], [/gene/DDB_G0275693 tpp1C], [/gene/DDB_G0287357 tpp1D], [/gene/DDB_G0283033 tpp1E]). The Tpp1 proteins are lysosomal serine proteases, which remove tripeptides from the N-terminus of proteins and is conserved from mammals to amoebae. Mutations in tripeptidyl peptidase 1 have been associated with infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), a neurodegenerative disease. <br />The ''Dictysotelium''Tpp1F protein was shown to have tripeptidyl-peptidase 1 activity. It also interacts with the Golgi pH regulator GPHR ( gene [/gene/DDB_G0283855 gpr89]) and localizes to the ER and to lysosomes. The single ''tpp1F'' knockout does not show any developmental or growth phenotype, possibly because of functional redundancy in the protein family [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28546289  (Stumpf et al. 2017)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 23-OCT-2017 PF

DDB_G0283453	Robert Dodson	Cyclic di-(3':5')-guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP), a major prokaryote signalling intermediate, has been identified in the eukaryote ''Dictyostelium''. the DgcA protein synthesizes c-di-GMP in a GTP-dependent manner and is expressed at the slug tip, the site of stalk cell differentiation. Disruption of the DgcA gene blocks fruiting body development at the stage of slug migration. Culmination and stalk formation are restored by exposing DgcA-null slugs to wild type secretion products or to c-di-GMP. Moreover, c-di-GMP specifically induces stalk gene expression in cell monolayers. <br />Like the bacterial proteins, Dictyostelium DgcA contains a C-terminal GGDEF domain, which is essential for DgcA function. DgcA has been identified in all four clades of Dictyostelia, and the ''P. pallidum'' DgcA (PPA_G1423310) expressed in the ''D. discoideum'' DgcA null mutant restores stalk formation and culmination. This research identifies the long-elusive stalk-inducing morphogen and a role for c-di-GMP in eukaryotes [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22864416  (Chen and Schaap, 2012)].<br />[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28057864  (Chen et al. 2017)] further investigated the c-di-GMP signal transduction pathway and demonstrated that the stalk-inducing signal cyclic diguanylate (c-di-cGMP) activates cAMP synthesis by adenylate cyclase A ([/gene/DDB_G0281545 acaA]) which is specifically expressed at the apical tip. cAMP then activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) ([/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC], [/gene/DDB_G0279413 pkaR]), which then triggers stalk differentiation.

DDB_G0283917	Robert Dodson	''sir2A'' was found to be expressed during both growth and development with maximum expression during the loose aggregation stage.

DDB_G0288181	Petra Fey	''Dictyostelium'' responds to heat shock like most eukaryotes by inducing the synthesis of a small number of specific genes. One of these heat shock genes, hspA, encodes the 60 kDa protein Hsp60 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6775994  (Loomis and Wheeler, 1980)]. Hsp60 is imported into mitochondria where it can act as a molecular chaperonin [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12952082  (Kotsifas et al., 2002)]. Antisense inhibition of ''hspA'' was used to generate cells with a deficiency of Hsp60 that were shown to have defects in growth and multicellular morphogenesis. These symptoms could be overcome by reducing the activity of the AMP dependent protein kinase AMPK [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17332500  (Bokko et al., 2007)]. The investigators suggest that mitochondrial disease is caused by chronic AMPK signaling rather than by insufficient ATP. Furthermore, Francione and colleagues found in mitochondrially diseased cells mutated in gene ''hspA'' or gene ''[/gene/DDB_G0294034 rnlA]'' these mutations also secondarily cause increased AMPK signaling, resulting in an enhanced ''Legionella pneumophila'' infection rate [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19638422  (Francione et al., 2009)].

DDB_G0277901	Robert Dodson	The AP-3 adaptor complex (AP-3 complex) is comprised of 4 subunits: beta ([/gene/DDB_G0272578 ap3b-1], [/gene/DDB_G0274003 ap3b-2]), delta ([/gene/DDB_G0279537 ap3d1]), mu, and sigma ([/gene/DDB_G0275405 ap3s1]). ''apm3'' encodes the medium chain (mu subunit) of the AP-3 complex. The AP-3 complex is associated with the trans-Golgi network and endosomal membranes, and mediates delivery of membrane proteins to lysosomes. The ''apm3'' protein (mu3) shares 51% identity with the human mu3A. Expression levels of ''apm3'' remain constant throughout development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11179674  (de Chassey et al., 2001)]. ''apm3'' plays an essential role in the establishment of a compartmentalized endocytic system. In ''apm3'' null cells, post-lysosomes are generated more slowly than in wild-type cells, and the fusion of post-lysosomes with the cell surface is also defective, possibly because of defects in actin polymerization ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17010123 Charette et al. 2006]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18194410 Charette et al. 2008]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 30-JUL-2020 RD
DDB_G0271504	Robert Dodson	Seven BEACH domain-containing proteins have been identified in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome: [/gene/DDB_G0269150 lvsA], ''lvsB'', [/gene/DDB_G0280971 lvsC], [/gene/DDB_G0271502 lvsD], [/gene/DDB_G0282925 lvsE], [/gene/DDB_G0284333 lvsF], and [/gene/DDB_G0268088 lvsG]. LvsB is the closest ''Dictyostelium'' homolog of the mammalian Lyst protein (LYSosomal Trafficking regulator) that causes Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS), characterized by impaired lysosomal transport and resulting in partial albinism, immunodeficiency and neurological problems. <br />''lvsB'' null mutants have defects in lysosome organization and biogenesis, and exhibit enhanced regulated secretion of lysosomal enzymes, a phenotype reminiscent of the Chediak-Higashi syndrome ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11865029 Cornillon et al. 2002]). They also appear to have enlarged acidic lysosomes, probably due to an increase in fusion rates and suggesting that LvsB acts as a negative regulator of fusion ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11854420 Harris et al. 2002]). Consistent with its requirement for proper lysosome organization, LvsB is localized to the lysosome and phagocytic vesicle ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17488289 Kypri et al. 2007]). <br />LvsB contributes to lysosome function by antagonizing the function of Rab14 ([/gene/DDB_G0281337 rab14]), a protein that promotes homotypic fusion among lysosomes. Expression of activated Rab14 phenocopies the loss of LvsB, causing inappropriate heterotypic fusion between lysosomes and post-lysosomes while expression of inactivated Rab14 suppresses the phenotype of LvsB null cells and restores their lysosomal size and segregation from post-lysosomes. These results suggest that LvsB binds to late lysosomes and promotes the inactivation of DdRab14, which then allows the lysosomes to mature into post-lysosomes for eventual secretion ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23387437 Kypri et al. 2013]). Comparison of the phenotypes of ''lvsB'' null cells with those of two mutants known to be defective in lysosomal fission, ''apm3'' null ([/gene/DDB_G0277901 apm3]) and WASH null ([/gene/DDB_G0292878 wshA]), revealed differences in the temporal localization of the post-lysosomal marker vacuolin, vesicle acidity, and vesicle fusion dynamics, further supporting a role for ''lvsB'' as a negative regulator of vesicle fusion ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25086066 Falkenstein et al. 2014]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 29-JUL-2020 RD

Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rab GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Rab GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. Rab24 is similar to human RAB24, which has low GTPase activity due to lack of a conserved glutamine in a nucleotide binding region. ''Dictyostelium'' Rab24 also lacks a glutamine residue at the corresponding position suggesting that it may also have low intrinsic GTPase activity.

DDB_G0274391	Robert Dodson	''alfA'' was isolated from a cDNA library of polyA+ RNA prepared from membrane-bound polysomes [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2540036  (Muller-Taubenberger et al. 1989)]. It encodes a protein that is 44% identical to mammalian alpha-L-fucosidase, the enzyme which cleaves alpha-6-O-fucosyl bonds on oligosaccharides. The protein has an N-terminal signal sequence for membrane translocation and accumulates in lysosomes as well as the extracellular medium [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1310316  (Schopohl et al. 1992)]. The enzyme preferentially catalyzes the hydrolysis of alpha 1,6 GlcNAc fucosyl linkages but is also active on alpha 1,2 Gal and alpha 1,3 Glc fucosyl linkages. ''alfA'' starts to be expressed after 5 hrs of development and reaches a peak at 11 hrs of development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. Transcription is stimulated by pulses of cAMP that activate a DNA binding protein which recognizes a 58 bp region found 325 bp upstream of the start of translation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1851628  (May et al. 1991)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 21-SEP-2018 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0284329	Robert Dodson	''gefA'' (''aimless'') encodes a Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF, RasGEF). rasGEFs are key components of signaling networks in which they activate Ras family small GTPases by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP. ''gefA'' is expressed during both vegetative growth and development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16086850 Wilkins et al. 2005]), and is preferentially expressed in the anterior prestalk (tip) region of slugs ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11422293 Tsujioka et al. 2001]). The ''gefA'' gene was isolated during a screen for aggregation-defective mutants. ''gefA'' null mutants grow at a normal rate, but have impaired chemotaxis to cAMP and adenylate cyclase ([/gene/DDB_G0281545 acaA]) activation, both of which are critical for aggregation involved in sorocarp development. The motility of mutant cells appears normal, suggesting a defect in gradient sensing ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8793298 Insall et al. 1996]). ''gefA'' null cells also exhibit a defect in cAMP-mediated activation of guanylyl cyclase ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10473630 Lee et al. 1999]). Cells lacking GefA exhibit defects similar to those of ([/gene/DDB_G0281385 rasC]) null cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11500376 Lim et al. 2001]). GefA has been shown to specifically exchange GDP for GTP on RasC, but not on other ras proteins, including RasB, ([/gene/DDB_G0292998 rasB]) RasD, ([/gene/DDB_G0292996 rasD]) RasG ([/gene/DDB_G0293434 rasG]) or Rap1 ([/gene/DDB_G0291237 rapA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17380187 Kae et al. 2007]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11500376 Lim et al. 2001]). Disruption of ''gefA'' results in a more rapid, higher, and extended activation of the kinase Erk2 ([/gene/DDB_G0283903 erkB]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9020088 Aubry et al. 1997]). <br />''gefA'' is included within a Ras signaling complex, termed the Sca1 complex, which also includes an additional RasGEF GefH ([/gene/DDB_G0276963 gefH]), the protein phosphatase ([/gene/DDB_G0283601 pppA]), and a scaffold protein ([/gene/DDB_G0277843 scaA]). The Sca1 complex is recruited to the leading edge of chemotaxing cells where it regulates F-actin dynamics and signal relay by controlling the activation of RasC and the downstream target of rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2)-Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) pathway, and undergoes TORC2 and Akt/PKB-dependent negative feedback regulation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20493808 Charest et al. 2010]). Both cAMP and folate use the same GefA-RasC axis to mediate AKT and PKBR1 phosphorylation by TORC2 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23657816 Liao et al. 2013]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 18-MAR-2021 RD
DDB_G0269222	Robert Dodson	''gefB'' encodes a Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF, RasGEF). rasGEFs are key components of signaling networks in which they activate Ras family small GTPases by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP. ''gefB'' is expressed throughout growth and development in AX3 cells, with maximal expression after 8 hours of starvation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11102804 Wilkins et al. 2000)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16086850 Wilkins et al. 2005)]. ''gefB'' expression also increases during sexual development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15740584 Ishida et al. 2005)]. The similarity in phenotypes of ''gefB'' and ''rasS'' ([/gene/DDB_G0283537 rasS]) null mutants, and the observation that the phenotypes of ''gefB''/''rasS'' double null cells are no more severe than either parent suggests that RasS is activated by GefB ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11102804 Wilkins et al. 2000)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12854977 King and Insall et al. 2003)].<br />''gefB'' is involved in signaling pathways regulating motility and macropinocytosis. ''Dictyostelium'' cells in which the ''gefB'' gene is disrupted move unusually rapidly but are unable to perform macropinocytosis and therefore to grow in liquid medium. Phagocytosis is also significantly decreased in ''gefB'' null cells. ''gefB'' null cells are strikingly more flattened, elongate, polarized and dominated by a single large lamella in which F-actin is concentrated. Aggregation is delayed in ''gefB'' null cells and the mutants do not form aggregation streams. Mutant cells form few, small but normally proportioned fruiting bodies ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11102804 Wilkins et al. 2000]). ''gefB'' null cells extend blebs more frequently than wt cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26317626 Sugiyama et al. 2015]). In ''gefB'' null cells generated in an AX2 background, there is no macropinocytosis defect compared with ''gefB'' null cells generated in an AX3 background ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967009 Williams et al. 2019]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 23-MAR-2021 RD
DDB_G0268578	Robert Dodson	''gefV'' encodes a Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF, RasGEF). rasGEFs are key components of signaling networks in which they activate Ras family small GTPases by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP. The amino terminal region of GefV has approximately 12 leucine-rich repeats. ''gefV'' is expressed during both growth and development, with highest levels of expression at 12 hours of development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16086850 Wilkins et al. 2005)]. A high-throughput analysis suggests defects in development and slug migration in ''gefV'' mutants ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17659086 Sawai et al. 2007)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 18-MAY-2021 RD
DDB_G0275239	Robert Dodson	''zizC'' encodes a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF, RhoGEF). RhoGEFs are key components of signaling networks in which they activate Rho family GTPases by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP.

DDB_G0270340	Robert Dodson	''rapC'' encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Ras family of small GTPases. G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs, rasGEFs, rapGEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs, rasGAPs, rapGAPs) inactivate Ras GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. <br />''rapC'' plays an important role in controlling cytokinesis, cell migration, and multicellular development in ''Dictyostelium''. RapC is localized to the plasma membrane and intracellular vesicle membranes. ''rapC'' null cells display several defects: increased cell size; multi-nucleated cells; decreased migration speed, increased cell-substrate adhesion, and multiple tip formation during development. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29614268  (Park et al. 2018)]. Unlike other Ras family GTPases, ''rapC'' has an additional stretch of amino acids in the C-terminal region. Expression of full-length RapC rescues ''rapC'' null phenotypes, but expression of a truncated version of RapC lacking the C-terminal domain in ''rapC'' null cells fails to rescue the phenotypes. Moreover, fusion of the C-terminal domain of RapC onto RapA ([/gene/DDB_G0291237 rapA]) reverses the normal function of RapA, suggesting that the C-terminal residues of RapC may function as a suppressor of Ras signaling (Kim et al. 2021, PMID:34449058). RapA and RapC have opposite roles: RapC is a negative regulator of cell spreading and cell-substrate adhesion, thus increasing cell migration speed; however RapA positively regulates cell spreading and cell-substrate adhesion, thus decreasing cell migration speed (Jeon, et al. 2021, PMID: 34413965).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 21-SEP-2021 RD
DDB_G0286895	Robert Dodson	''grlD'' encodes a G-protein coupled receptor containing 7 transmembrane domains. ''grlD'' is expressed throughout growth and development, with peak expression between 12 and 14 hours of development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17501984  (Prabhu et al. 2007)]. Compared with wild type (wt) cells, ''grlD'' null cells have a decreased growth rate and a higher percentage have multiple nuclei, suggesting a cytokinesis defect in ''grlD'' null mutants. Cells lacking ''grlD'' were also insensitive to AprA ([/gene/DDB_G0281663 aprA])-induced proliferation inhibition [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29440579  (Tang et al. 2018)]. ''Dictyostelium'' cells bind polyphosphate, and polyphosphate inhibits both proliferation and proteasome activity, and induces aggregation in wt cells. ''grlD'' null cells do not bind polyphosphate and are unresponsive to polyphosphate-induced aggregation. In addition, in low nutrient conditions, physiological levels of polyphosphate reduced the proliferation of wild type cells, but not that of ''grlD'' or the small GTPase ''rasC'' ([/gene/DDB_G0281385 rasC]) null cells. In high nutrient conditions, the loss of RasC did not reduce the sensitivity of cells to polyphosphate. Cells lacking GrlD or RasC were unresponsive to polyphosphate-induced proteasome inhibition in all nutrient conditions. Taken together, these results suggest that GrlD is a receptor for extracellular polyphosphate and mediates polyphosphate-induced proliferation inhibition and proteasome inhibition. In addition these results suggest that polyphosphate regulates the proliferation of ''Dictyostelium'' by different signaling pathways depending on nutrient levels [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30785840  (Suess et al. 2019)].<br />To identify additional components of the polyphosphate proliferation inhibition signaling pathway, available mutants were screened for sensitivity to polyphosphate-induced proliferation inhibition under low-nutrient conditions. In addition to ''grlD'' and ''rasC'' null mutants, cells lacking the G protein component GpbA ([/gene/DDB_G0277143 gpbA]), the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor GefA ([/gene/DDB_G0284329 gefA]), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) ([/gene/DDB_G0286557 pten]), phospholipase C ([/gene/DDB_G0292736 plc]), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor-like protein A (IplA) ([/gene/DDB_G0292564 iplA]), polyphosphate kinase 1 (Ppk1) ([/gene/DDB_G0293524 ppk1]), or the TOR complex 2 component PiaA ([/gene/DDB_G0277399 piaA]) have significantly reduced sensitivity to polyphosphate-induced proliferation inhibition. Polyphosphate also upregulates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and cytosolic free Ca2+ levels in wild type ''Dictyostelium'' cells. However, polyphosphate did not significantly affect IP3 levels in null mutant cells of ''grlD'', ''gefA'', ''pten'', ''plC'', and ''piaA'', and polyphosphate did not significantly affect cytosolic free Ca2+ in cells lacking GrlD, GefA, RasC, IplA, Ppk1, or PiaA. Taken together, these results suggest that polyphosphate uses signal transduction pathways including IP3/Ca2+ to inhibit ''Dictyostelium'' proliferation (Tang, et al 2021, PMID:34154396).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-AUG-2021 RD
DDB_G0288251	Robert Dodson	''roco4'' encodes a large, multi-domain protein of the Roco family. Roco4 contains an amino terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region, a Roc small GTPase domain, a COR (C-terminal of Roc) domain, a protein kinase domain and a WD40 repeat domain in the C-terminal region. ''roco4'' is an ortholog of human LRRK2, mutations in which are associated with Parkinson disease. Eleven ''Dictyostelium'' proteins belong to the Roco family: ([/gene/DDB_G0291079 gbpC]), ([/gene/DDB_G0273259 qkgA-1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0269250 pats1]), Roco4, ([/gene/DDB_G0294533 roco5]), ([/gene/DDB_G0279417 roco6]), ([/gene/DDB_G0267472 roco7]), ([/gene/DDB_G0286127 roco8]), ([/gene/DDB_G0288183 roco9]), ([/gene/DDB_G0291710 roco10]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0268636 roco11]).<br />''roco4'' is expressed during both growth and development with the highest level of expression during the slug stage of development. Roco4 showed a uniform cytosolic distribution and ''roco4'' expression is highly enriched in the prestalk region of the slug. Slug development is delayed in ''roco4'' null mutants, and stalks in ''roco4'' mutants have severely reduced cellulose levels, leading to unstable stalks that are unable to properly lift the spore head above the surface ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20348387 van Egmond and van Haastert 2010]). The 3D structure of Roco4 has been solved. Roco4 mutants lacking serine 1187 and serine 1189 lack kinase activity and are unable to rescue ''roco4'' null developmental defects, whereas Roco4 with a G1179S mutation (Roco4(G1179S)) displays an increase in kinase activity. Mutations in the corresponding residue in human LRRK2 are associated with late-onset Parkinson disease ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22689969 Gilsbach, et al. 2013]). Roco4(G1179S) mutants also display similar developmental defects as ''roco4'' null mutants. Both the ''roco4'' null mutant and the Roco4(G1179S) mutant have defects in phototaxis, and additional phenotypes which are characteristic of mitochondrial impairment. In ''roco4'' null cells, there is an increased level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a significant increase in basal mitochondrial respiration, ATP synthesis rate, and complex I activity compared with wild type cells, while the Roco4(G1179S) mutant displays lower mitochondrial activity. Taken together, these results indicate that ''Dictyostelium discoideum'' Roco4 and human LRRK2 have a conserved role in the regulation of mitochondrial activity (Rosenbusch, et al. 2021, PMID:34568343).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 13-OCT-2021 RD
DDB_G0267956	Robert Dodson	AbiA is a member of the Scar/WAVE complex, consisting of (Scar) ([/gene/DDB_G0285253 scrA]), ''abiA'', ([/gene/DDB_G0279175 hspc300]), (PIR121) ([/gene/DDB_G0287855 pirA]), and ([/gene/DDB_G0274519 napA]). In migrating cells, the Scar/WAVE complex regulates the production of lamellipods and pseudopods through Arp2/3 complex activation. The Scar/WAVE complex localizes to the front of pseudopods and the tips of filopods, cell-cell contact zones, and the cell leading edge. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22891261 Veltman et al. 2012]). AbiA interacts directly with Scar ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17314411 Caracino et al. 2007]), Hspc300 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21701600 Linkner et al. 2011]) and also with VASP family protein ([/gene/DDB_G0289541 vasP]). ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28889942 Litschko et al. 2017]). <br />In ''abiA'' null mutants, ScrA levels are reduced by approximately 5-fold, and both ScrA and PIR121 fail to localize to the leading edge of pseudopods. During chemotaxis to folate, ''abiA'' null mutants move more slowly, are more rounded, and extend smaller protrusions than do wild-type cells. ''abiA'' null mutants exhibit a reduced growth rate and 2-fold increase in the number of multinucleated cells due to a defect in cytokinesis. An ''abiA''/''scrA'' double null mutant has defects similar to a ''scrA'' single null mutant-a smaller cell size and reduced cell motility ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18261908 Pollitt and Insall 2008]). A series of ''abiA'' deletion mutants identified a minimal Abi fragment that stabilized the Scar/WAVE complex, demonstrating that Abi is not required for recruitment or activation of the Scar/WAVE complex and instead likely functions to modulate its activity. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24036345 Davidson et al. 2013]). Deletion of ''abiA'' in an AX2 background (''abiA''/AX2 null) had a negligible effect on levels of additional SCAR complex subunits and revealed additional phenotypes. ''abiA''/AX2 null cells have an increased number of crowns and aberrant pseudopodia, filopodia, and macropinocytic cups. ''abiA''/AX2 null cells have a reduced cell speed, but normal directionality. When grown in shaken suspension, they did not display a cytokinesis effect, although other SCAR complex subunits did so. Development of ''abiA''/AX2 null on SM agar plates was impaired, with cells only forming small slugs and fruiting bodies; however, a less severe phenotype was observed on non-nutrient plates. In ''abiA''/AX2 null cells, VasP did not translocate to newly formed pseudopods as in wt cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28889942 Litschko et al. 2017]).<br />AbiA is constitutively phosphorylated in unstimulated ''Dictyostelium'' cells, and both folate and cAMP chemoattractant signaling enhance Abi phosphorylation. Cell-substrate adhesion induces Abi phosphorylation while osmotic shock inhibits it, revealing that Abi phosphorylation is responsive to extracellular signals. Abi phosphorylation is decreased in pirA null cells expressing pirA with point mutations to eliminate Rac GTPase binding. As Scar/WAVE activation depends on Rac1 GTPAse ([/gene/DDB_G0277869 rac1A]), ([/gene/DDB_G0268622 rac1B]), ([/gene/DDB_G0282365 rac1C]) interacting with PirA, this confirms that Abi phosphorylation is a result of Scar/WAVE complex activation. Co-expression of unphosphorylatable and phosphomimetic Abi and Scar mutants in ''scrA''/''abiA'' double null cells suggests that neither Scar nor Abi phosphorylation is required for Scar/WAVE complex activation. Dictyostelium cells in which Scar and Abi are both unphosphorylatable can still form pseudopods, but migrate substantially faster. These results suggest that phosphorylation of both Scar and Abi enable the regulation of pseudopodia after they are formed, and that extracellular signals and environmental responses modulate cell migration by fine tuning Scar/WAVE complex behaviour after it has been activated.

DDB_G0274519	Robert Dodson	NapA (Nap1) is a member of the Scar/WAVE complex, consisting of (Scar) ([/gene/DDB_G0285253 scrA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0287855 pirA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0279175 hspc300]), ([/gene/DDB_G0267956 abiA]), and NapA. In migrating cells, the Scar/WAVE complex regulates the production of lamellipods and pseudopods through Arp2/3 complex activation. The Scar/WAVE complex localizes to the front of pseudopods and the tips of filopods, cell-cell contact zones, and the cell leading edge ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22891261 Veltman et al. 2012]). NapA and PirA interact to form an independent heterodimeric subcomplex prior to formation of the mature Scar/WAVE complex ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21701600 Linkner et al. 2011]).<br />In ''napA'' null mutants in an AX3 background, Scar protein levels are reduced approximately 10-fold, and PirA levels are reduced by approximately half. ''napA'' null mutant cells move more slowly toward the chemoattractant folate, appear more rounded, and extend much smaller protrusions than wild type (wt) cells. ''napA'' null mutant cells are also much smaller and have a large reduction in F-actin levels. In addition, ''napA'' null mutants have defects in cell-substrate adhesion and development, including delayed aggregation and slugs which are defective in phototaxis. ''pirA''/''napA'' double null phenotypes reveal that that NapA is required for ''pirA'' null phenotypes ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16581519 Ibarra et al. 2006]). Disruption of ''napA'' in an AX2 background (''napA''/AX2 null) leads to a drastic decrease or disappearance of the other four SCAR/WAVE complex components. ''napA''/AX2 null cells are more spread than wt cells and form broad areas of membrane ruffle-like structures at their peripheries. ''napA''/AX2 null cells also move more slowly than wt cells and have defects in cytokinesis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28889942 Litschko et al. 2017]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 20-JAN-2022 RD
DDB_G0292390	Petra Fey	The ''atg1'' gene was isolated among several members of the autophagy family of genes, conserved from yeast to man ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12626495 Otto et al., 2003]). Macroautophagy is used by eukaryotic cells to recycle non-essential cellular components during starvation and development. ''atg1''-null mutants grow slower when compared to wild type. Survival during nitrogen starvation is severely reduced. Upon starvation mutant cells also show little turnover of cellular components. Multicellular development of the mutant is severely impaired. On bacterial lawns mutant cells do not aggregate, and axenically grown cells plated on filters form loose mounds only. Consistent with this block in development, ''atg1''-null cells produce no viable spores. Wild-type cells in a chimaera do not rescue the developmental defects, showing that the atg1 mutation is autonomous. In the mutant, another autophagy protein, [/gene/DDB_G0286191 atg8a], shows a change in localization when compared with wild-type cells. The mutant phenotype of ''atg1''-null cells is the most severe compared with other autophagy mutants; [/gene/DDB_G0289881 atg5] and [/gene/DDB_G0271096 atg7] mutants have a comparative phenotype but slightly milder defects, while [/gene/DDB_G0269244 atg6A] and [/gene/DDB_G0286191 atg8a] mutants show significantly milder defects ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14736886 Otto et al., 2004]). Tekinay and colleagues showed that the kinase activity of Atg1 is required for autophagy and that the kinase-negative mutant acts in a dominant-negative way when expressed in wild-type cells, blocking autophagy and development. By creating a temperature sensitive mutant they found that ATG1 is required throughout development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17031001  Tekinay et al., 2006]).<br />Kosta ''et al.'' investigated the relationship between autophagy and vacuolar cell death by deleting ''atg1'' in HMX44A cells, a ''Dictyostelium'' cell line that is able to develop as a monolayer. During autophagic cell death after starvation and addition of DIF, wild-type cells develop large vacuoles before rupturing while HMX44A-atg1-null cells die, however, without the formation of vacuoles. Reproducing this result in different insertion and deletion mutants suggests that, in an autophagic vacuolar cell death model, the inactivation of ''atg1'' supresses vacuolization but not death ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15358773 Kosta et al., 2004]). Laporte ''et al.'' showed that, when stimulated, ''atg1''-null cells displayed not only developmental vacuolar cell death but also necrotic cell death (NCD), which is characterized by swift mitochondrial uncoupling, ATP depletion, and increased oxygen consumption ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16810325 Laporte et al., 2007], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17150370 Tresse et al., 2007]). Mitochondrial uncoupling and increased oxygen consumption were reversible upon removal of mitochondrial uncoupler whereas ATP depletion was not. The first irreversible event of NCD is lysosome permeabilization ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18951891 Giusti et al., 2009]). Lam ''et al.'' found that the additional deletion of the only paracaspase gene ([/gene/DDB_G0293196 pcp]) in ''Dictyostelium'', which also appears to have no bcl-2 family members, did not have any effect on necrotic or autophagic cell death; the phenotype of the double atg1-/pcp- mutant is identical to the phenotype of the single ''atg1''- mutant ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17889831 Lam et al., 2007]).<br />[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22575510 Pflaum et al. 2012] show that LPS treatment leads to induction of autophagosomal maturation in cells responding to the bacterium S. aureus, but that LPS-enhanced clearance of bacteria is reduced in cells deficient for ''atg1'' and ''atg9'' ([/gene/DDB_G0285323 atg9]). These results link microbial pattern recognition with the induction of autophagy in ''Dictyostelium''.<br />[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25646440 Gerstenmaier et al. 2015] established a link between autophagic machinery and non-lytic ejection of mycobacteria. The authors show that ejecting mycobacteria are escorted by a distinct polar autophagocytic vacuole. In ''atg1'' null cells, there is a decrease in cell-to-cell transmission of mycobacteria, and an increase in cell leakage due to a compromised plasma membrane. These findings suggest a previously unidentified, highly ordered interaction between bacteria and the autophagic pathway. <br />Infection of ''Dictyostelium'' by ''Mycobacterium marinum'' triggers an autophagic response, including increased expression of autophagy genes ''atg1'' and ([/gene/DDB_G0286191 atg8a]), autophagosome formation, and recruitment of the bacterium to Mycobacteria-containing vacuole (MCV). However, antagonistically, Mycobacterium also uses its ESX-1 secretion system to repress autophagic flux and support its survival inside the MCV. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28414774 Cardenal-Munoz et al. 2017]).<br />[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26246495 Mesquita et al. 2015] used yeast two-hybrid screening to investigate the Atg1 complex. The core of the complex is formed by Atg1, Atg13 ([/gene/DDB_G0269162 atg13]), and Atg101 ([/gene/DDB_G0288287 atg101]). Atg1 was also shown to interact with transketolase ([/gene/DDB_G0272618 tkt-1], [/gene/DDB_G0274019 tkt-2]) and ''atg1'' null mutants reduced transketolase activity, suggesting the presence of a regulatory pathway between autophagy and the pentose phosphate pathway in ''Dictyostelium''.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 7-FEB-2022 PF

DDB_G0275795	Robert Dodson	''pripA'' encodes a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing protein. PripA was identified during a screen for proteins that localize to the macropinosome during the macropinosome maturation process, specifically the fusion of Rab5 ([/gene/DDB_G0271984 rab5A])-marked early macropinosomes to Rab7 ([/gene/DDB_G0269236 rab7A])-marked late macropinosomes. PripA localizes to both macropinosomes and phagosomes, and PripA localizes to newly formed macropinosomes by interacting with phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2) via the PH domain. PripA colocalizes with Rab5A on macropinosomes. PripA forms a complex with the Rab GAP TbcrA ([/gene/DDB_G0282575 tbcrA]) that has GAP activity towards the Rab GTPase Rab5A. PripA also interacts specifically with the constitutively active form of Rab GTPase 7A, suggesting that PI(3,4)P2 and Rab7A mediate the recruitment of PripA to macropinosomes. In both ''pripA'' and ''tbcrA'' null cells, there is decreased inactivation of Rab5A, suggesting that PripA and TbcrA function in a complex. In ''pripA'' null cells there is also decreased localization of TbcrA to macropinosomes and phagosomes, as well as delayed macropinocytic and phagocytic cargo degradation. Taken together, these results support a role for the PripA-TbcrA complex in regulating macropinosome maturation by linking early and late macropinocytic compartments and promoting Rab conversion (Tu, et al 2022, PMID:35379834).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-APR-2022 RD

DDB_G0271734	Robert Dodson	''rapgap1'' encodes a Rap GTPase-activating protein (GAP, rapGAP). RapGAPs are key components of signal transduction networks in which they inactivate Rap GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. RapGAP1 belongs to the Rap/Ran-GAP superfamily. ''rapgap1'' is expressed at all stages of development. Upon uniform cAMP stimulation, cytosolic RapGAP1 translocates to the cell cortex, and in chemotaxing cells RapGAP1 preferentially localizes to the leading edge. RapGAP1 binds to cortexillin ctxA ([/gene/DDB_G0289483 ctxA]), and CtxA negatively regulates the cortical localization of RapGAP1. ''rapgap1'' null cells show extended kinetics of chemoattractant-mediated Rap1 ([/gene/DDB_G0291237 rapA]) activation and exhibit a moderate increase in the level of Rap1-GTP, indicating that RapGAP1 has specific GAP activity for RapA.<br />''rapgap1'' null cells are more flattened and spread that wild type (wt) cells and have a significant increase in cell-substrate attachment, while cells overexpressing RapGAP1 have a defect in cell-substrate attachment. In addition, ''rapgap1'' null cells have decreased myosin II assembly and aberrant F-actin levels. ''rapgap1'' null cells move slower than wt cells in a cAMP chemoattractant gradient; whereas mutant cells overexpressing RapGAP1 move at a higher speed, indicating a defect in chemotaxis to cAMP. These results indicate that ''rapgap1'' is involved in the regulation of cell adhesion, chemotaxis and myoII assembly through the mediation of RapA activation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18039932 Jeon et al. 2007]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 28-MAR-2022 RD
DDB_G0292188	Robert Dodson	''DDB_G0292188'' is a member of a conserved family of ''Dictyostelium'' proteins containing a von Willebrand factor A-like domain and a P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase domain. An RNA-sequencing approach was used to identify mTORC1/AMPK-regulated transcriptional networks and associated signaling pathways that are essential for early developmental induction. A combination of starvation and treatment with rapamycin was used to identify a set of ~500 transcripts upregulated during the transition from growth to development, among which is ''DDB_G0292188''. A ''DDB_G0292188'' null mutant is unable to aggregate and displays reduced expression of CAR1 ([/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1]),([/gene/DDB_G0273533 carA-2]), supporting a role for ''DDB_G0292188'' in the induction of early development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31319820  (Jaiswal and Kimmel, 2019)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 05-APR-2022 RD
DDB_G0287689	Robert Dodson	Microtubules are cytoskeletal components found in all eukaryotes where they buttress cellular extensions and connect chromosomes to centrosomes. These hollow filaments are polymers of alpha-tubulin and beta-tubulin that are encoded by ''tubA'' and ([/gene/DDB_G0269196 tubB]), respectively, in Dictyostelium [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8227212  (Trivinos-Lagos et al. 1993)]. Polymerization of alpha/beta heterodimers is initiated at the MicroTubule Organizing Center (MTOC) and extends in the plus end direction to the periphery of the cell where the microtubules can couple to the actin cortex and make rapid sweeping movements across the whole cell [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15527790  (Fischer et al. 2004)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16942924  (Heinrich and Sackmann 2006)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20658257  (Samereier et al. 2010)]. The molecular motors dynein ([/gene/DDB_G0276355 dhcA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0280849 dicA]) and the kinesin genes organize the microtubule network and use it to move cargo to specific destinations [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8816999  (Koonce and Samso, 1996)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10545495  (Pollock et al. 1999)]. The sequence of the gene encoding alpha-tubulin has been highly conserved during evolution making it useful for phylogenetic analyses of the dictyostelids [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17068267  (Schaap et al. 2006)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 06-NOV-2017 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0293362	Robert Dodson	SRCP1, a novel molecular chaperone unique to ''Dictyostelium'', suppresses aggregation of proteins with long polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts. PolyQ-expanded proteins misfold and lead to formation of protein aggregates, causing neurodegenerative diseases in human. SRCP1 is necessary for the resistance of ''Dictyostelium'' to polyglutamine aggregation, and is sufficient to convey resistance to polyglutamine aggregation in human and zebrafish. In the presence of SRCP1, aggregation-prone polyQ proteins are degraded via the proteasome. SRCP1 lacks any identifiable chaperone domains but rather utilizes a C-terminal domain that resembles amyloid to suppress aggregation of polyQ-expanded proteins.

DDB_G0288247	Robert Dodson	''Dictyostelium'' AIF, which is very similar to human AIFM1, has been shown to localize to the mitochondrion in living cells, and to translocate to the nucleus during cell death. The activity of DdAIF was tested by using cytoplasmic extract from Dictyostelium cells, incubating the extract either with human or ''Dictyostelium'' nuclei. In both assays, the extract caused chromosome condensation and DNA degradation. Polyclonal DdAIF antibodies inhibited the nuclear degradation process. These results suggest that like its human counterpart, DdAIF is involve in mitochondrial organization and participates in the cell death pathway [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11598188  (Arnoult et al. 2001)].<br />Antisense mutants of ''aif'' exhibited slower growth and delayed developmental morphogenesis. ''aif'' antisense cells also contained higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative DNA damage and calcium levels, but lower intracellular ATP levels. Under oxidative stress, ''aif'' antisense cells showed early mitochondrial membrane depolarization followed by AIF translocation from mitochondria to nucleus. Cells also exhibited necrotic cell death as compared to paraptoptic cell death in control cells. These results suggest that AIF is involved in growth and development in D. discoideum by regulating ROS levels [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27663234  (Kadam et al. 2016)]. In addition, antisense ''aif'' mutants also exhibited compromised oxidative phosphorylation and lower transcript levels of various subunits of the electron transport chain. ''aif'' downregulation also resulted in increased mitochondrial fission and defects in mitochondrial structure, further revealing the role of ''aif'' in mitochondrial organization and homeostasis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31991113  (Kadam et al. 2020)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 17-MAR-2020 RD

DDB_G0280921	Robert Dodson	''DDB_G0280921'' contains a Phox (PX) homology domain and a P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase domain. Phox domains are involved in phosphoinositide-binding. An RNA-sequencing approach was used to identify mTORC1/AMPK-regulated transcriptional networks and associated signaling pathways that are essential for early developmental induction. A combination of starvation and treatment with rapamycin was used to identify a set of ~500 transcripts upregulated during the transition from growth to development, among which is ''DDB_G0280921''. A ''DDB_G0280921'' null mutant is unable to aggregate and displays reduced expression of CAR1 ([/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0273533 carA-2]), supporting a role for DDB_G0280921 in the induction of early development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31319820  (Jaiswal and Kimmel, 2015)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 06-APR-2022 RD
DDB_G0269236	Robert Dodson	''rab7A'' encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Rab family of small GTPases. G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rab GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Rab GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. RabGAP Rbg3 ([/gene/DDB_G0281891 rbg3]) is a possible RabGAP for Rab7A ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24349132 Kuwayama et al. 2013]). Rab7A interacts with TipC ([/gene/DDB_G0267422 tipC]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30709847  (Munoz-Braceras et al. 2019)], and with the PH domain-containing protein PripA ([/gene/DDB_G0275795 pripA]) (Tu, et al 2022, PMID:35379834). ''rab7A'' is expressed at a relatively high level throughout both growth and development (unpublished results cited in [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9243512 Buczynski et al. 1997]). Rab7A localizes to the plasma membrane, macropinosomes, lysosomes, post-lysosomes, and maturing phagosomes ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7929276 Temesvari et al. 1994], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7593293 Adessi et al. 1995]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9243512 Buczynski et al. 1997]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11553719 Rupper et al. 2001]), (Tu, et al 2022, PMID:35379834). Proteomic analysis reveals that Rab7A also localizes to prespore secretory vesicles ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11990506 Srinivasan et al. 2001]) and the Legionella-containing vacuole ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18980612 Urwyler et al. 2009]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24373249 Hoffmann et al. 2013]), [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28183814  (Schmolders et al. 2017)]. Rab7A is also associated with ''M. marinum''-containing compartments ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25779329 Barisch, et al. 2015]). <br />Rab7A is a key regulator of endo-lysosomal trafficking and plays a role in macropinosome and phagosome maturation. Dominant-negative ''rab7A'' cells display a decrease in both the rate of pinocytosis and the efflux rate of fluid phase material compared with wt cells. In addition, the phagocytosis rate is reduced by approximately a third in dominant-negative ''rab7A'' cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9243512 Buczynski et al. 1997]). Rab7 positively regulates macropinocytosis: expression of dominant-negative ''rab7A'' results in the almost complete abolishment of macropinocytosis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11553719 Rupper et al. 2001]). Rab7 also plays a role in phagosome maturation. Delivery of alpha-mannosidase ([/gene/DDB_G0292206 manA]) to early phagosomes is abolished and delivery of the lysosomal membrane glycoprotein LmpA ([/gene/DDB_G0267406 lmpA]) is decreased in dominant-negative ''rab7A'' cells. Full-sized phagosomes still form in dominant-negative ''rab7A'' cells; however, the regulation of phagosomal pH is aberrant ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11559753 Rupper et al. 2001]). The Rab7A interactor PripA also binds phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate and forms a complex with the Rab GAP TbcrA ([/gene/DDB_G0282575 tbcrA]), which has GAP activity towards Rab5A ([/gene/DDB_G0271984 rab5A]). The PripA-TbcrA complex thus promotes Rab5-to-Rab7 conversion and macropinosome and phagosome maturation (Tu, et al 2022, PMID:35379834).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 18-APR-2022 RD

DDB_G0286553	Robert Dodson	''rab21'' (''rabB'') encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Rab family of small GTPases. G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rab GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Rab GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. ''rab21'' is expressed at a relatively constant level throughout growth and development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8294041  (Bush et al. 1993)]. Proteomic analysis revealed that Rab2A is localized to lipid droplets ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24036346 Du, et al. 2013]) and also to the Legionella-containing vacuole [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28183814  (Schmolders et al. 2017)]. <br />''rab21'' is involved in a signaling pathway that regulates phagocytosis. Rab21 interacts with two LIM-domain containing proteins: ([/gene/DDB_G0267490 ChLim]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0275157 limF]). Expression of constitutively active Rab21, overexpression of LimF, or deletion of ChLim increases the rate of phagocytosis above that of wild type; conversely, expression of a dominant-negative Rab21, deletion of LimF, or overexpression of ChLim inhibits phagocytosis. These results suggest a complex interactive relationship in which the three proteins function as a regulatory unit to direct phagocytic uptake: activated Rab21 positively regulates phagocytosis, ChLim serves to inhibit the activating function of Rab21, while LimF is required for the activating function of Rab21 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15962002  (Khurana et al. 2005)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 30-SEP-2020 RD

Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rab GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Rab GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. Rab subfamily small GTPases in many organisms are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking. Rab6 is an ortholog of human Rab6A and Rab6B. Proteomic analysis revealed that Rab6 is localized to the Legionella-containing vacuole [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24373249  (Hoffmann et al. 2013)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28183814  (Schmolders et al. 2017)], and also to lipid droplets ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24036346 Du, et al. 2013]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 12-NOV-2020 RD
DDB_G0282929	Robert Dodson	''atg12'' was isolated together with several other members of the autophagy family of genes, conserved from yeast to man ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12626495 Otto et al. 2003)]. Macroautophagy is used to recycle cellular components during starvation and development. In yeast, ATG12 covalently binds ATG5 and ATG16 then associates non-covalently with ATG5-ATG12 to form a complex which acts as an E3 ligase to link ATG8 to phosphatidyl-ethanolamine of the growing membrane of the autophagosome. ''Dictyostelium'' ATG12 recognizes ATG7 ([/gene/DDB_G0271096 atg7]) in 2-hybrid assays which suggests the formation of an E1-like complex ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26246495 Mesquita et al. 2015)]. ''atg12'' is expressed throughout growth and development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420 Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. Deletion of ''atg12'' in both wt and ''atg16'' null ([/gene/DDB_G0275323 tipD]) revealed defects in development, cell viability, endocytosis and autophagosome maturation. Core autophagy genes are upregulated in ''atg12'' and ''tipD'' mutants while genes related to cell motility and phagocytosis are down-regulated. An increase in ubiquitin-positive protein aggregates with a corresponding decrease in proteasomal activity in these mutants reveals that the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is dependent on intact autophagy for full activity. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30669443 Fischer et al. 2019)]. ''atg5'' single ([/gene/DDB_G0289881 atg5]), ''atg5''/''atg12'' double, and ''atg5''/''atg12''/''tipD'' triple knockout mutants revealed similar defects in the conjugation of ATG8 to phosphatidylethanolamine, development, and cell viability indicating that Atg5, Atg12, and TipD act as a functional unit in canonical autophagy. However, distinct and sometimes opposite phenotypes in growth, macropinocytosis, phagocytosis, and proteasomal activity in these mutants reveal autophagy-independent functions for these genes ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32397394 Karow et al. 2020)]Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 08-DEC-2020 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis and Ricardo Escalante

DDB_G0291237	Robert Dodson	''rapA'' (rap1) is a key regulator of cell adhesion and cell motility in ''Dictyostelium.'' ''rapA'' is a vital gene that encodes a small G protein of the Ras family of molecular switches. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7507418 Rebstein et al. 1993)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12186953 Kang et al. 2002)]. RapA plays a role in the progression through cytokinesis. During cell division, activated Rap1 (RapGTP) is found at the furrow where the contractile ring of myosin forms ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25298405 Plak et al. 2014)]. When the daughter cells separate, RapGTP is localized to the poles. RapGTP interacts with Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (RacGEF1) ([/gene/DDB_G0277987 gxcA]) and coordinates microtubules, actin and myosin organization in the cytoskeleton ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22644079 Mun and Jeon 2012)]. cAMP signaling activates Rap1 through the RasG ([/gene/DDB_G0293434 rasG]) pathway by stimulating the RapGEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) activity of GbpD ([/gene/DDB_G0282373 gbpD]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16769729 Kortholt et al. 2006)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18180289 Bolourani et al. 2008)]. RapGTP accumulates at the front of cells migrating chemotactically and activates myosin heavy chain kinase ([/gene/DDB_G0291231 mhkA]) leading to the disassembly of myosin II at the front ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18039932 Jeon et al. 2007)]. RapGTP also activates guanylyl cyclase and the protein kinase Phg2 ([/gene/DDB_G0283699 phg2]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12186953 Kang et al. 2002)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16769729 Kortholt et al. 2006)]. There are several GAP activities that return RapGTP to the inactive GDP form, including RapGAP1 ([/gene/DDB_G0271734 rapgap1]) and RapGAP3 ([/gene/DDB_G0271806 rapgap3]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18039932 Jeon et al. 2007)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19284976 Jeon et al. 2009)]. RapA induces cell-cell adhesion through direct binding to TalB ([/gene/DDB_G0287505 talB]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26744136 Plak et al. 2016)]. In addition, RapA binds the TORC2 component Sin1/Rip3 ([/gene/DDB_G0284611 ripA]) and positively regulates the RasC-mediated ([/gene/DDB_G0281385 rasC]) activation of TORC2. RasC also activates TORC2 through directly binding the tor kinase ([/gene/DDB_G0281569 tor]), suggesting that dual Ras/Rap1 regulation of TORC2 may allow for integration of Ras and Rap1 signaling pathways in directed cell migration. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27172998 Khanna et al. 2016)]. GflB ([/gene/DDB_G0286773 gflB]) was identified as a G-alpha-stimulated, Rap1-specific GEF required to balance Ras and Rap signaling at the leading edge of chemotaxing cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27237792 Liu et al. 2016)]. PKA ([/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC], [/gene/DDB_G0279413 pkaR]) plays a role in gradient sensing and chemotaxis to cAMP by regulating the Ras ([/gene/DDB_G0281385 rasC], [/gene/DDB_G0293434 rasG]), Rap1 and TORC2 signaling pathways in response to cAMP ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28302905 Scavello et al. 2017)]. Fusion of the C-terminal domain of RapC ([/gene/DDB_G0270340 rapC]) onto RapA reverses the normal function of RapA, suggesting that the C-terminal residues of RapC may function as a suppressor of Ras signaling (Kim et al. 2021, PMID:34449058). RapA and RapC have opposite roles: RapC is a negative regulator of cell spreading and cell-substrate adhesion, thus increasing cell migration speed; however RapA positively regulates cell spreading and cell-substrate adhesion, thus decreasing cell migration speed (Jeon, et al. 2021, PMID: 34413965).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 21-SEP-2021 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0279417	Robert Dodson	''roco6'' encodes a large, multi-domain protein of the Roco family. Roco6 contains an N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region, a Roc small GTPase domain, a COR (C-terminal of Roc) domain, and a protein kinase domain, and two WD40 repeat domains and a PH domain in the C-terminal region. Eleven ''Dictyostelium'' proteins belong to the Roco family: ([/gene/DDB_G0291079 gbpC]), ([/gene/DDB_G0273259 qkgA-1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0269250 pats1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0288251 roco4]), ([/gene/DDB_G0294533 roco5]), Roco6, ([/gene/DDB_G0267472 roco7]), ([/gene/DDB_G0286127 roco8]), ([/gene/DDB_G0288183 roco9]), ([/gene/DDB_G0291710 roco10]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0268636 roco11]).<br />Roco6 is localized to the cytosol and ''roco6'' is expressed during both growth and development with the highest level of expression during the slug stage of development.

DDB_G0268634	Petra Fey	''pde3'' encodes a type I phosphodiesterase which participates along with PdeD ([/gene/DDB_G0274383 pdeD]) in breaking down intracellular cGMP. Pde3 is activated by bivalent cations, mainly by manganese and to a lesser degree by magnesium; the protein sequence contains two metal binding sites [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11171061  (Kuwayama et al. 2001)]. Pde3 has a higher affinity for cGMP than PdeD but has lower activity [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17040207  (Bader et al. 2007)]. Pde3 accounts for about 20% of the intracellular cGMP hydrolysis. Cells lacking Pde3 have increased basal cGMP levels. Overexpression of the catalytic domain of ''pde3'' results in only a slight decrease in internal cGMP levels and fails to give an overt morphological phenotype [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11171061  (Kuwayama et al. 2001)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 03-NOV-2021 PF; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0279175	Robert Dodson	Hspc300 (brk1) is a member of the Scar/WAVE complex, consisting of (Scar) ([/gene/DDB_G0285253 scrA]), Hspc300, ([/gene/DDB_G0267956 abiA]), (PIR121) ([/gene/DDB_G0287855 pirA]), and ([/gene/DDB_G0274519 napA]). In migrating cells, the Scar/WAVE complex regulates the production of lamellipods and pseudopods through Arp2/3 complex activation. The Scar/WAVE complex localizes to the front of pseudopods and the tips of filopods, cell-cell contact zones, and the cell leading edge. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22891261 Veltman et al. 2012]). Hspc300 interacts directly with Scar ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17314411 Caracino et al. 2007]), forms homotrimers and interacts with Scar and AbiA ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21701600 Linkner et al. 2011]). <br />Disruption of ''hspc300'' leads to a complete loss of Scar protein and PIR121 fails to localize to the leading edge of actin pseudopods as in wild type cells. ''hspc300'' null mutants have phenotypes similar to ''scrA'' null mutants, including decreased cell motility speed and smaller, more rounded cells with smaller protrusions. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19228419 Pollitt and Insall 2009]). ''hspc300'' null cells are also multinucleate revealing a cytokinesis defect ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20530573 King et al. 2010]). Deletion of ''hspc300'' in an AX2 background (''hspc300''/AX2 null) revealed additional phenotypes. In ''hspc300''/AX2 null cells Scar and AbiA levels are severely decreased. ''hspc300''/AX2 null cells largely lacked macropinocytic cups and have a moderate decrease in filopodium formation. ''hspc300''/AX2 null cells have both a reduced cell speed and directionality of movement. Although ''hspc300''/AX2 single null cells lack developmental defects, ''hspc300''/''vasP''/AX2 ([/gene/DDB_G0289541 vasP]) double null cells have severe developmental defects and on PB agar plates development did not advance beyond the slug stage. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28889942 Litschko et al. 2017]).<br />Biochemical analysis and X-ray crystallography studies suggest a model in which Hspc300 serves as an adaptor protein to promote assembly of the mature Scar complex. Homotrimeric Hspc300 maintains a dynamic pool of Hspc300 monomers which associate with Scar and AbiA to form a heterotrimeric subcomplex. In the final assembly step, Hspc300 then serves as an adaptor protein to stabilize and coordinate the assembly of the Scar/AbiA/Hspc300 with heterodimeric NapA/PirA to form the mature Scar/WAVE complex ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21701600 Linkner et al. 2011]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 12-JAN-2022 RD
DDB_G0281781	Robert Dodson	''DDB_G0281781'' contains a transmembrane domain. An RNA-sequencing approach was used to identify mTORC1/AMPK-regulated transcriptional networks and associated signaling pathways that are essential for early developmental induction. A combination of starvation and treatment with rapamycin was used to identify a set of ~500 transcripts upregulated during the transition from growth to development, among which is ''DDB_G0281781''. A ''DDB_G0281781'' null mutant is unable to aggregate and displays reduced expression of CAR1 ([/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0273533 carA-2]), supporting a role for DDB_G0281781 in the induction of early development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31319820  (Jaiswal and Kimmel, 2015)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 07-APR-2022 RD
DDB_G0286191	Robert Dodson	The ''atg8'' gene was isolated among several members of the autophagy family of genes, conserved from yeast to man [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12626495  (Otto et al., 2003)]. Macroautophagy is used by eukaryotic cells to recycle non-essential cellular components during starvation and development. In ''atg8''-null cells, survival during nitrogen starvation is reduced. Upon starvation mutant cells show little turnover of cellular components. Development of the mutant is slightly impaired. On bacterial lawns cells aggregate mainly in the center of plaques and not in the periphery, and multi-tipped aggregates form very small fruiting bodies. Axenically grown cells plated on filters form multi-tipped aggregates that develop into small but normal looking fruiting bodies. These fruiting bodies produce few viable, detergent-resistent spores. Wild-type cells in a chimaera do not rescue the developmental defects, showing that the atg8 mutation is autonomous. The phenotype of the ''atg8''-null mutant is almost identical to that of the [/gene/DDB_G0269244 atg6A]-null mutant. Both mutants have the mildest defects when compared to [/gene/DDB_G0292390 atg1], [/gene/DDB_G0289881 atg5], and [/gene/DDB_G0271096 atg7] mutants [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14736886  (Otto et al., 2004)]<br />Infection of ''Dictyostelium'' by ''Mycobacterium marinum'' triggers an autophagic response, including increased expression of autophagy genes ([/gene/DDB_G0292390 atg1]) and ''atg8a'' autophagosome formation, and recruitment of the bacterium to Mycobacteria-containing vacuole (MCV). However, antagonistically, Mycobacterium also uses its ESX-1 secretion system to repress autophagic flux and support its survival inside the MCV. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28414774 Cardenal-Munoz et al. 2017]).<br />Generation of single and double knockout mutants of ''atg8a'' and ''atg8b'' ([/gene/DDB_G0290491 atg8b]) revealed unique roles for each protein in autophagy. Knockout of ''atg8b'' displayed only a mild develpmental phenotype, while ''atg8a'' mutants displayed a complex phenotype with delayed development, reduced growth, phagocytosis and cell viability, and an increase in ubiquitinylated proteins and a concomitant decrease in proteasomal activity. However knockout mutants of both genes displayed more severe phenotypes than the single ''atg8a'' mutant, indicating that both proteins function in parallel. Immunofluorescence analysis of knock-out strains suggests a crucial function for ATG8b in autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Atg8b localized around ATG8a and was presumably mainly present on the outer membrane of the autophagosome while Atg8a appears to be mainly associated with the inner membrane. These results suggest that Atg8b predominantly acts as adapter for the autophagy machinery at the outer and Atg8a as cargo receptor at the inner membrane of the autophagosome.

DDB_G0269102	Robert Dodson	''arcD'' encodes the 20 kDa subunit of the Arp2/3 complex [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11807934  (Insall et al. 2001)]. The seven subunits of this 200 kDa complex are encoded by ([/gene/DDB_G0277825 arcA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0282813 arcB]), ([/gene/DDB_G0292804 arcC]), ''arcD'', ([/gene/DDB_G0288319 arcE]), ([/gene/DDB_G0272106 arpB]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0283755 arpC]). The subunits of mammalian Arp2/3 are very similar to ''Dictyostelium'' homologs. Arp2/3 binds to the side of F-actin filaments and initiates polymerization of a new F-actin chain at an angle of 70 degrees leading to a branched actin network that can alter the shape of cells. The ability to nucleate new actin filaments is greatly stimulated by direct interactions with members of the WASP/SCAR family [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11807934  (Insall et al. 2001)]. The Arp2/3 complex largely mediates the actin polymerization response to chemotactic stimulation and contributes to cell motility, pseudopod extension and adhesion in Dictyostelium chemotaxis. The complete Arp2/3 complex is essential for growth; partial loss of activity of either ArcB or ArpB impairs growth and chemotaxis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17553489  (Langridge and Kay, 2007)]. mRNA from each of the genes encoding Arp2/3 subunits accumulates coordinately to reach a peak at 3 hours of development and gradually decreases thereafter [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. The Arp2/3 complex interacts with the protein CARMIL, which serves as a scaffold for the assembly of a larger complex of proteins involved in the nucleation and termination of actin filament assembly. The complex consists of CARMIL ([/gene/DDB_G0292386 carmil]), AcpA, ([/gene/DDB_G0267374 acpA]) AcpB, ([/gene/DDB_G0272104 acpB]) the Arp2/3 complex, and type I myosins MyoB ([/gene/DDB_G0289117 myoB]) and MyoC ([/gene/DDB_G0276617 myoC]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11425877  (Jung et al. 2001)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 30-MAY-2019 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0283349	Robert Dodson	G proteins are evolutionarily conserved heterotrimeric GTP binding proteins that can act as molecular switches. ''gpaA'' encodes G-alpha 1, one of the dozen alpha subunits that associate with the unique G-beta and G-gamma subunits ([/gene/DDB_G0277143 gpbA], [/gene/DDB_G0274125 gpgA]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2500658  (Pupillo et al. 1989)]. G-alpha 1 expression is cell-type-specific, being preferentially expressed in the anterior prestalk AB cells and anterior-like cells. Cells lacking G-alpha 1 grow and develop reasonably well although they tend to make fruiting bodies with elongated stalks. Strains overexpressing G-alpha 1 culminate abnormally with an aberrant stalk differentiation suggesting that G-alpha 1-mediated signaling pathways play an essential role in regulating development by controlling prestalk morphogenesis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1670774  (Kumagai et al. 1991)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7821221  (Dharmawardhane et al. 1994)]. Several lines of evidence indicate that G-alpha 1 plays a role in regulating the activity of phospholipase C ([/gene/DDB_G0292736 plc]) during early development, most likely in conjunction with an unknown receptor [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8280098  (Bominaar and van Haastert, 1994)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9525920  (Brazill et al. 1998)]. Later in development, G-alpha 1 plays a role in the signal transduction pathway by which the polyketide 4-methyl-5-pentylbenzene-1,3 diol (MPBD) stimulates production of the phosphopeptide signaling molecule, spore differentiation factor 1 (SDF-1) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21602484  (Anjard et al. 2011)]. The surface receptor for MPBD is CrlA ([/gene/DDB_G0280983 crlA]), a GPCR similar to the cAMP receptor CAR1 ([/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1], [/gene/DDB_G0273533 carA-2]). It appears to be coupled to a trimeric G protein containing the G-alpha 1 subunit. After exchange of GTP for GDP on G-alpha 1, the protein kinase GskA ([/gene/DDB_G0272110 gskA]) is either directly or indirectly inhibited [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21602484  (Anjard et al. 2011)]. When GskA is inhibited, the SDF-1 precursor can be released to generate SDF-1 in the surrounding fluid.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 18-APR-2019 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0273533	Robert Dodson	A family of four highly related G-protein coupled receptors, CAR1, CAR2, CAR3, and CAR4 (genes ''[/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1]'' ''[/gene/DDB_G0288179 carB]'', ''[/gene/DDB_G0277829 carC]'', ''[/gene/DDB_G0277831 carD]'', respectively), mediate developmental responses to cAMP [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2049880  (Saxe et al., 1991]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7496377  Ginsburg et al., 1995)]. CAR1 and CAR3 have 56% amino acid identity and show approximately equal affinity to cAMP in vitro [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1537842  (Johnson et al., 1992)]. Both are coupled to trimeric G proteins with the Galpha2 subunit (gene ''[/gene/DDB_G0276267 gpaB]''). CAR1 is expressed immediately after the initiation of development. Single-molecule imaging using TIRF microscopy showed that CAR1 is uniformly distributed and diffuses rapidly in the plane of the membrane. The rate constant for dissociation of cAMP from CAR1 was found to be about 1 second [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11679673  (Ueda et al., 2001)]. CAR1 is phosphorylated upon persistent stimulation with cAMP resulting in internalization on a timescale of 5 min followed by degradation after 13 min [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21541374  (Serge et al. 2013)]. cAMP induces the cAR1-mediated dissociation of G protein subunits to a similar extent in both undifferentiated and differentiated cells. Dissociation is stimulated by caffeine and requires the microtubule network [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29698704  (Islam et al. 2018)]. <br />Cells lacking CAR1 fail to aggregate or express developmentally regulated genes that are induced by pulses of cAMP [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1692327  (Sun et al., 1990)]. Stimulation of cAMP and cGMP accumulation in response to addition of cAMP is lost in these cells. However, they can still respond to high concentrations of cAMP by using the CAR3 receptor [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9578623  (Kim et al., 1998)]. A double ''carA/carC'' mutant lacking both receptors shows no response to cAMP and an abolished synthesis of cGMP [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7949426  (Insall et al., 1994)]. Using a non-phosphorylatable carA mutant, Brzostowski and colleagues demonstrated that receptor phosphorylation is required to regulate adenylyl cyclase adaptation, long-range oscillatory cAMP wave production and cytoskeletal actin responses [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23902692  (Brzostowski et al. 2013) ]. Sites critical for cAMP binding, coupling to G proteins and regulated phosphorylation were delineated by PCR-mediated random mutagenesis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8999903  (Kim et al., 1997]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8999904  Milne et al., 1997)]. <br />Binding of cAMP to CAR1 results in the transient activation of TorC2 and the adenylyl cyclase ACA through a Ras pathway [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20660630  (Cai et al., 2010]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23657816  Liao et al., 2013)]. An incoherent feedforward loop in which ligand bound CAR1 activates both a Ras-GEF and a Ras-GAP can result in perfect adaptation of activated Ras about 20 seconds after addition of cAMP in a spatially uniform manner [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22215733  (Takeda et al., 2012)]. The LEGI model points out that membrane localization of the activator (GEF) and free diffusion of the inhibitor (GAP) can generate a spatial gradient of activated Ras within the cells in response to an external gradient of cAMP [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10221901  (Parent and Devreotes, 1999)]. Ultrasensitivity resulting from the opposing activities of GEF and GAP can dramatically amplify the signal and ensure that cells only respond to constant or rising concentrations of cAMP and that they do not respond to the decreasing concentrations of cAMP in the back of a wave [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25249632  (Skoge et al., 2014)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated 08-DEC-2015 PF; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

DDB_G0274125	Robert Dodson	The gamma subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins is a small evolutionarily conserved protein that carries a lipid tail for membrane association. In ''Dictyostelium'' ''gpgA'' encodes a G gamma protein of 69 amino acids that requires the phosducin-like protein PhLP1 ([/gene/DDB_G0292850 phlp1]) for addition of a lipid tail to the carboxy terminal amino acid motif CSVL [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11598203  (Zhang et al. 2001)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16135826  (Knol et al. 2005)]. G gamma forms a stable dimer with G-beta ([/gene/DDB_G0277143 gpbA]) and is involved in multiple signal transduction pathways. Both subunits are required for these functions. G-beta/G-gamma reassociates with G-alpha subunits to form a heterotrimeric G protein that can associate with surface receptors of the GPCR family. The subunits remain as receptor bound heterotrimers until GDP is displaced by GTP on G-alpha subunits. Amplification of the external chemoattractant signal appears to occur downstream of the G protein response since G-beta/G-gamma is distributed on the surface membrane in direct proportion to the concentration of external cAMP in a gradient [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10669414  (Jin et al. 2000)]. G-beta/G-gamma associates with an ELMO/DOCK complex that may act as a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22754623  (Yan and Tin, 2012)]. RacB ([/gene/DDB_G0279605 racB]) and the Arp2/3 complex are also found together with G-beta/G-Gamma and this complex may mediate signaling from GPCR to the actin cytoskeleton during chemotaxis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22647486  (Xu and Jin, 2012)]. The rate of dissociation of G-beta/G-gamma from the membrane increases when cAMP is bound to CAR1 ([/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1], [/gene/DDB_G0273533 carA-2]) which may facilitate activation of cytosolic components such as RasGAPs [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19584094  (Elzie et al. 2009)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 24-APR-2019 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0292592	Robert Dodson	Lst8, along with RipA ([/gene/DDB_G0284611 ripA]), PiaA ([/gene/DDB_G0277399 piaA]), and TOR ([/gene/DDB_G0281569 tor]), make up the TORC2 complex that plays a critical role in chemotaxis and relay of the cAMP signal [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16079174  (Lee et al. 2005)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22081140  (Kortholt et al. 2011)]. Lst8 is a highly conserved homolog of yeast LST8 (lethal with sec thirteen). ''lst8'' null cells show reduced cell polarity, chemotactic speed and directionality, phosphorylation of PKB ([/gene/DDB_G0268620 pkbA]) and PKBR1 ([/gene/DDB_G0290157 pkgB]) and activation of adenylyl cyclase ([/gene/DDB_G0281545 acaA]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16079174  (Lee et al. 2005)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31263268  (Senoo et al. 2019)]. They also show elevated rates of phagocytosis of both yeast and latex beads [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22266904  (Rosel et al. 2012)]. Treating ''lst8'' null or piaA null mutant cells with artificial pulses of cAMP does not rescue development indicating that these components of TORC2 are essential for Ras stimulation or activity of the complex [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10473630  (Lee et al. 1999)]. During chemotaxis to cAMP, RacE ([/gene/DDB_G0280975 racE]) promotes phosphorylation of PkbA and PkgB by assembling a supercomplex with RasC-GTP ([/gene/DDB_G0281385 rasC]) and the TORC2 components tor, piaA and lst8. This supercomplex formation is controlled by the chemoattractant-induced phosphorylation of racE at S192 by the glycogen synthase kinase gskA ([/gene/DDB_G0272110 gskA]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31263268  (Senoo et al. 2019)].

''myoC'' mRNA is abundant during the first two hours of development, decreases to a minimum at T=8 hrs and then reaccumulates to a peak at T=11 hrs. ''mlcC'' is coordinately expressed. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)].<br />Disruption of ''myoC'' had no obvious consequences to growth or development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7622596  (Peterson et al. 1995)].

MyoJ is a large protein with a myosin motor domain at the N-terminus and a coiled-coil structure in the tail that is predicted to lead to dimerization [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8636147  (Hammer and Jung, 1996)]. MyoJ has the domain structure of class-V unconventional myosins but its sequence is not closely related [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8884597  (Peterson et al. 1996)]. MyoJ is a processive motor that can move long distances along actin filaments without dissociating [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18650439  (Taft et al. 2008)]. MyoJ localizes to contractile vacuole membranes, moves them along the actin cortex, and is required for efficient osmoregulation and the normal accumulation of contractile vacuole membranes in the cortex.

DDB_G0283761	Petra Fey	Cytoplasmic fucosyltransferase activity specific for the addition of fucose to the Skp1 protein ([/gene/DDB_G0269230 fpaA]/[/gene/DDB_G0273251 fpaB-1]) was first identified by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1577798 Gonzalez-Yanes and colleagues (1992)]. This alpha(1,2)-fucosyltransferase activity was later attributed to the [/gene/DDB_G0283761 pgtA] gene; null cells for ''pgtA'' exhibit increased cell size in phase contrast microscopy and oxygen requirement that is very similar to that of [/gene/DDB_G0275699 gnt1] null cells, but rescues the defective fruiting body morphology ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11423539 van der Wel et al. 2001]). The PgtA protein (also known as FT85) was later determined to be a bifunctional diglycosyltransferasealso that also possesses glycoprotein-N-acetylgalactosamine 3-beta-galactosyltransferase activity. Thus this protein adds a fucose and galactose modification to Skp1 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15123660 Ketcham et al. 2004]).<br />Glycosylation of Skp1 has been extensively studied in ''Dictyostelium''. The initial step in Skp1 glycosylation involves the hydroxylation of Pro143 by a proline hydroxylase ([/gene/DDB_G0277759 phyA], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9660787 Teng-umnuay et al. 1998]). HyPro143 is then modified by the glycosyltransferase [/gene/DDB_G0275699 gnt1], which transfers a GlcNAc (N-acetylglucosamine) to the Skp1 protein ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10593934 Teng-umnuay et al. 1999]). Then the Skp1-GlcNAc is extended PgtA, which processively adds galactose and fucose ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11423539 van der Wel et al. 2001], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12244067 van der Wel et al. 2002]). Subsequently two additional galactose residues are added by [/gene/DDB_G0283005 agtA] to yield the Skp1 pentasaccharide (GGFGGnOSkp1; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16495217 Ercan et al. 2006], reviewed in [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128470 West and Kim 2019]). <br />Skp1 is the only detectable protein modified by purified PgtA added to pgtA-null extracts ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19687007 Wang et al. 2009]).Further investigations showed that full SKP1 glycosylation is required for optimal oxygen sensing during development, for example [/gene/DDB_G0283005 agtA] knockout and overexpression mutants require an elevated oxygen level to culminate, similar to the phenotype of the [/gene/DDB_G0277759 phyA] mutant ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19687007 Wang et al. 2009], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22128189 Zhang et al. 2011], reviewed in [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25988702 West and Blader 2015]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-MAR-2020 PF
DDB_G0288771	Robert Dodson	''darA'' encodes the protein darlin, an atypical guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) of the Rap1 GTPase-GDP dissociation stimulator 1 family. ''darA'' is an ortholog of the human RAP1GDS gene, which encodes Rap1 GTPase-GDP dissociation stimulator 1 and which acts as a guanine exchange factor (GEFs) through a distinct exchange mechanism compared with canonical GEFs. Darlin was identified as protein that binds to the Rho small GTPases RacE ([/gene/DDB_G0280975 racE]) and RacC ([/gene/DDB_G0293526 racC]). Darlin preferentially binds to the GDP-bound form of RacE. ''darA'' is expressed throughout growth and development. ''darA'' null cells lack defects in growth or cytokinesis. When plated on agar plates with bacteria as a food source, ''darA'' null mutants are able to ingest bacteria and form colonies at the same rate as wild type cells, and when bacteria are depleted the mutant cells develop normally. However, under a layer of starvation buffer, ''darA'' null cells are unable to initiate aggregation, and when grown on non-nutrient agar, ''darA'' null cells form very small aggregating centers leading to smaller sized slugs and fruiting bodies. Taken together, these results suggest that darlin is a non-canonical GEF which plays a role in the efficient streaming of cells in early development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9802899 Vithalani et al. 1998]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26940518 Rivero et al. 2016]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 13-JUL-2021 RD
DDB_G0284845	Robert Dodson	''gxcC'' encodes a Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF, RacGEF). RacGEFs are key components of signaling networks in which they activate Rho family GTPases by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP. The N-terminal region of GxcC can translocate to the cell cortex and leading edge upon cAMP stimulation; however, the full-length protein is uniformly cytosolic and does not translocate to the cell cortex upon chemoattractant stimulation, possibly because GxcC exists in an autoinhibited state. (unpublished results, cited in ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23363311 Plak et al. 2013]). GxcC binds directly and specifically to active, GTP-bound RapA ([/gene/DDB_G0291237 rapA]). A constitutively active RapA mutant increases the activation of Rac GTPases. Downstream targets of GxcC were identified by immunoblotting, and GxcC showed affinity towards RacG ([/gene/DDB_G0269178 racG]), RacH ([/gene/DDB_G0269240 racH]), RacE ([/gene/DDB_G0280975 racE]), RacI ([/gene/DDB_G0277897 racI]), and RacL ([/gene/DDB_G0292816 racL]) with the highest affinity to RacG and RacH. GxcC did not show exchange activity towards any of these Rac GTPases; however, this may result from GxcC being in an auto-inhibited state. ''gxcC'' null cells lack defects in chemotaxis and cytokinesis but displayed a significant delay in the formation of slugs, the Mexican hat structure and fruiting body formation, indicating that GxcC plays a role in the regulation of development. Taken together, these results suggest that GxcA is an effector of RapA and the interaction between RapA and GxcC also suggests that GxcC links Rap and Rac signaling during development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23363311 Plak et al. 2013]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26940518 Rivero et al. 2016]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 30-JUN-2021 RD
DDB_G0269250	Robert Dodson	''pats1'' encodes a large, multi-domain protein of the Roco family. Pats1contains N-terminal myotubulin-related and catalytic protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domains, a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region, a Roc small GTPase domain, a COR (C-terminal of Roc) domain, a protein kinase domain and a WD40 repeat domain in the C-terminal region. ''pats1'' is an ortholog of human LRRK2, mutations in which are associated with Parkinson disease. Eleven ''Dictyostelium'' proteins belong to the Roco family: ([/gene/DDB_G0291079 gbpC]), ([/gene/DDB_G0273259 qkgA-1]), Pats1, ([/gene/DDB_G0288251 roco4]), ([/gene/DDB_G0294533 roco5]), ([/gene/DDB_G0279417 roco6]), ([/gene/DDB_G0267472 roco7]), ([/gene/DDB_G0286127 roco8]), ([/gene/DDB_G0288183 roco9]), ([/gene/DDB_G0291710 roco10]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0268636 roco11]).<br />''pats1'' was identified in a REMI mutagenesis screen designed to isolate genes required for cytokinesis. Pats1 localizes to the cytosol and interacts with the actin cytoskeleton. ''pats1'' is expressed during both growth and development with the highest level of expression during the slug stage of development. Both ''pats1'' null mutants and cells overexpressing ''pats1'' have a severe cytokinesis defect, indicating that ''pats1'' is an important regulator of cytokinesis in ''Dictyostelium''. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12529423 Abysalh et al. 2003]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20348387 van Egmond and van Haastert 2010]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 13-OCT-2021 RD
DDB_G0288183	Robert Dodson	''roco9'' encodes a large, multi-domain protein of the Roco family. Roco9 contains an N-terminal RhoGAP domain, a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region, a Roc small GTPase domain, a COR (C-terminal of Roc) domain, and a protein kinase domain. Eleven ''Dictyostelium'' proteins belong to the Roco family: ([/gene/DDB_G0291079 gbpC]), ([/gene/DDB_G0273259 qkgA-1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0269250 pats1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0288251 roco4]), ([/gene/DDB_G0294533 roco5]), ([/gene/DDB_G0279417 roco6]), ([/gene/DDB_G0267472 roco7]), ([/gene/DDB_G0286127 roco8]), Roco9, ([/gene/DDB_G0291710 roco10]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0268636 roco11]).<br />Roco9 is localized to the cytosol and ''roco9'' is expressed during both growth and development with the highest level of expression during aggregation.

DDB_G0280689	Robert Dodson	''tgrB1'' is a member of a family of genes with a high degree of natural polymorphism [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19285397  (Benabentos et al. 2009)]. ''tgrB1'' encodes a cell surface glycoprotein that acts in conjunction with TgrC1 ([/gene/DDB_G0280531 tgrC1]) to mediate post-aggregation EDTA-resistant cell-cell adhesion and kin recognition [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21700835  (Hirose et al. 2011]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23477311  Chen et al. 2013]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490801  Chen et al. 2014)]. Signal transduction from TgrB1/TgrC1 regulates expression of post-aggregative genes and thereby synchronizes temporal aspects of differentiation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16386729  (Iranfar et al. 2006]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21700835  Hirose et al. 2011)].<br />Independent isolates from nature show a high degree of polymorphism of TrgB1 and TgrC1. Cells with compatible TgrB1 / TgrC1 pairs form common aggregates but distant kin that express variants are excluded. This mechanism of kin recognition protects from potential cheaters that fail to make their fair share of stalk cells [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23910661  (Ho et al. 2013]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26018043  Ho and Shaulsky 2015)]. ''tgrB1'' and ''tgrC1'' are coordinately transcribed between 2 and 8 hours of development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. Transcriptome analysis of several ''tgrB1'' / ''tgrC1'' gene replacement strains revealed 68 differentially expressed genes at 8 hours and 85 genes at 12 hours development (only one gene differentially expressed at both time points). This underlines the necessity of allorecognition facilitating the transition to multicellularity during development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26395484  (Hirose et al. 2015)]. TgrB1/TgrC1 mediated development but not allorecognition is regulated by N-glycosylation through Alg9 ([/gene/DDB_G0279349 alg9]), a putative mannosyl transferase [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26359303  (Li et al. 2015)]. Cells lacking all three adenylate cyclase genes ([/gene/DDB_G0281545 acaA], [/gene/DDB_G0267376 acrA], [/gene/DDB_G0274569 acgA]) and overexpressing PKA ([/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC], [/gene/DDB_G0279413 pkaR]) exhibited cell polarization, tissue formation and cooperation when mixed with allotype-compatible wild-type cells, but not with incompatible ''tgrB1''-/''tgrC1''-/QS31 cells, indicating that TgrB1/TgrC1-mediated allorecognition and tissue formation do not require cAMP production as long as PKA is active (Hirose, et al 2021, PMID: 34169317).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 10-June-2016 PF; summary contribution: Bill Loomis

DDB_G0269272	Robert Dodson	''mtm6'' encodes myotubularin phosphatase, a member of the well conserved myotubularin family. Mtm6 localizes to the leading-edge plasma membrane of migrating cells, as well as to macropinocytic cups. The plasma membrane localization of Mtm6 was abolished in a quintuple PI3K null mutant ([/gene/DDB_G0278727 pikA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0283081 pikB]), ([/gene/DDB_G0275011 pikC]), ([/gene/DDB_G0268548 pikF]), ([/gene/DDB_G0282625 pikG]), but greatly enhanced in ''pten'' ([/gene/DDB_G0286557 pten]) null cells. Mtm6 binds specifically to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) and phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2), and has phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate phosphatase activity. In ''mtm6'' null cells, the level of trailing edge protein Teep1 ([/gene/DDB_G0277777 teep1]) associated with the plasma membrane is slightly increased. Taken together, these results suggest that Mtm6 likely mediates the removal of PI(3,5)P2 from the front of migrating cells, and the formation of a reverse PI(3,5)P2 gradient on the plasma membrane, which in turn regulates the localization of cell trailing edge membrane proteins (Li, et al 2022, PMID:35186938).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 03-MAR-2022 RD
DDB_G0276465	Robert Dodson	The ''sepA'' gene was identified during a REMI screen for proteins involved in regulating cytokinesis. A ''sepA'' null mutant displayed defects in both cytokinesis and multicellular development. ''sepA'' null cells are multinucleate and distinctly larger than wild-type cells. Mitosis is normal in ''sepA'' null cells, but organization of cortical actin is disturbed and proper formation of cleavage furrows is impaired. Cytokinesis in ''sepA'' null cells is highly variable from almost normal to completely missing. ''sepA'' null cells also have delayed aggregation with smaller than normal fruiting bodies. These results suggest that ''sepA'' acts as a master regulator of other elements in the signal transduction network controlling cleavage furrow formation and constriction ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19479821  Muller-Taubenberger et al. 2009]).<br />The sepA kinase interacts with the Scar complex and phosphorylates ScaR ([/gene/DDB_G0285253 scrA]). Similar to a ''scrA'' phosphorylation defective mutant, ''sepA'' null cells formed long-lived, exaggeratedly long pseudopods ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32745097 Singh et al. 2020]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 25-FEB-2021 RD
DDB_G0275035	Robert Dodson	''zizA'' encodes a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF, RhoGEF). RhoGEFs are key components of signaling networks in which they activate Rho family GTPases by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP. ''zizA'' is expressed throughout growth and development. ZizA is distributed throughout the cytosol with enrichment at the microtubule organizing center (MTOC). ZizA does not show chemoattractant-induced localization or cause any alterations in cell movement or filopod formation. ''zizA'' null mutant cells do not have defects in development or cytokinesis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22366457 Pakes et al. 2012]). The adaptor protein ElmoE ([/gene/DDB_G0279657 elmoE]) associates with the Rho GTPase RacB ([/gene/DDB_G0279605 racB]) as well as with both ZizA and DocC ([/gene/DDB_G0292004 docC]), suggesting that ElmoE, DocC, and ZizA may form an evolutionarily conserved Elmo/Dock complex to serve as a GEF for RacB ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22264729 Yan et al. 2012]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 21-MAY-2021 RD
DDB_G0293084	Robert Dodson	''zizB'' encodes a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF, RhoGEF). RhoGEFs are key components of signaling networks in which they activate Rho family GTPases by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP. ''zizB'' is highly expressed throughout growth and development. ZizB is localized to the cytosol and enriched at the cell cortex and is excluded from the trailing edge during cell migration. In ''zizB'' null cells, development is delayed, and the cells have sparse, collapsed fruiting bodies with thickened stalks. In addition, ''zizB'' null cells displayed a significant reduction in both directionality and velocity during chemotaxis to cAMP. Cells overexpressing ''zizB'' show a twofold increase in filopodia formation and also have defects in cytokinesis. ZizB has multiple binding partners, including the Rho GTPases Rac1A ([/gene/DDB_G0277869 rac1A]), RacA ([/gene/DDB_G0286555 racA]), RacC ([/gene/DDB_G0293526 racC]), and RacG ([/gene/DDB_G0269178 racG]). In addition, ZizB co-immunoprecipitates with a number of actin or myosin-associated proteins, including the tubulins TubA ([/gene/DDB_G0287689 tubA]), TubB ([/gene/DDB_G0269196 tubB]), the actin filament nucleator ForA ([/gene/DDB_G0279607 forA]), F-actin capping protein subunits AcpA ([/gene/DDB_G0267374 acpA]) and AcpB ([/gene/DDB_G0272104 acpB]) and the Arp2/3 complex proteins ArcA ([/gene/DDB_G0277825 arcA]) and ArcB ([/gene/DDB_G0282813 arcB]). The ''zizB'' mutant phenotypes and ZizB binding partners suggest a central role for ZizB in actin cytoskeletal organization and cortical stabilization. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22366457 Pakes et al. 2012]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23247359 Pakes et al. 2012]). Overexpression of ZizB phenocopies the effects of Rac1A overexpression, suggesting that ZizB functions as RhoGEF for ''rac1A''. In addition, ZizB may also function as a RhoGEF for ''racA'', ''racC'', and ''racG'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26940518 Rivero et al. 2016]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 26-MAY-2021 RD
DDB_G0279733	Robert Dodson	''gxcDD'' encodes a multidomain protein containing a CH domain, two IQ motifs, three PH domains, a RhoGEF domain and an ArfGAP domain. GxcDD is a putative Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF, RacGEF). RacGEFs are key components of signaling networks in which they activate Rho family GTPases by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP. ''gxcDD'' is expressed throughout development. The full-length GxcDD protein is present throughout the cytosol, membrane and cytoskeleton. However, the localization and roles of different GxcDD protein domains have been examined separately. The amino-terminal CH domain functions as a membrane anchor for the protein, while the C-terminal ArfGAP domain of GxcDD associates with the cell cortex and phagosomes. The RhoGEF domain of GxcDD interacts in vivo with several Rac GTPases: Rac1a ([/gene/DDB_G0277869 rac1A]), RacA ([/gene/DDB_G0286555 racA]), RacC ([/gene/DDB_G0293526 racC]), RacE ([/gene/DDB_G0280975 racE]), RacH ([/gene/DDB_G0269240 racH]), and RacI ([/gene/DDB_G0277897 racI]); however, the GEF activity of GxcDD has not been investigated. The C-terminal PH domain of GxcDD binds to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). ''gxcDD'' null cells lack defects in growth, phagocytosis, cytokinesis or actin cytoskeleton organization. However, ''gxcDD'' null cells display defects in development, with abnormal aggregation and streaming and delayed culmination. These results indicate that GxcDD is involved in Rac signaling pathways regulating streaming and development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17584488 Mondal et al. 2007]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26940518 Rivero et al. 2016]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 08-JUL-2021 RD

DDB_G0282067	Robert Dodson	''zntB'' was identified as a putative zinc transporter by sequence homology and a phylogenetic analysis placed ''zntB'' in a subfamily along with ([/gene/DDB_G0283629 zntA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0269332 zntC]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0291141 zntD]). All four genes are expressed in pstAB cells or at the stalk entrance during culmination, but none of the four genes are expressed in a STATa ([/gene/DDB_G0281381 dstA]) null strain [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18415938  (Sunaga et al. 2008)]. ZntB localizes to organelles of the endosomal pathway, including zinc-containing endosomes, phagosomes, and recycling endosomes and/or the Golgi apparatus. ZntB also localizes to ''Mycobacterium smegmatis''-containing vacuoles (MCV), and Zn2+ accumulates inside the MCV at the same time. In ''zntB'' null cells, there is a 60% reduction in Zn2+ ion transport into the phagosome compared with wt, suggesting that ZntB is the main Zn2+ transporter into lysosomes and post-lysosomes [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30404827  (Barisch et al. 2018)]. During ''Mycobacterium marinum'' infection, both ZntB and ZntA localize to the Mycobacteria-containing vacuole, and expression of both genes is increased. In ''zntB'' null cells, MCVs accumulate less Zn2+ than in wt, however intracellular ''M. marinum'' growth is decreased compared with wt cells. This result suggests that additional Zn2+ dependent defense mechanisms may be employed by ''Dictyostelium'' against bacterial infection (Hanna, et al. 2021, PMID:33531393).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 02-SEP-2021 RD
DDB_G0294533	Robert Dodson	''roco5'' encodes a large, multi-domain protein of the Roco family. Roco5 contains an N-terminal Rho-GEF domain followed by a PH domain, a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region, a Roc small GTPase domain, a COR (C-terminal of Roc) domain, and a protein kinase domain in the C-terminal region. Roco5 has sequence similarity to human LRRK2, mutations in which are associated with Parkinson disease. Eleven ''Dictyostelium'' proteins belong to the Roco family: ([/gene/DDB_G0291079 gbpC]), ([/gene/DDB_G0273259 qkgA-1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0269250 pats1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0288251 roco4]), Roco5, ([/gene/DDB_G0279417 roco6]), ([/gene/DDB_G0267472 roco7]), ([/gene/DDB_G0286127 roco8]), ([/gene/DDB_G0288183 roco9]), ([/gene/DDB_G0291710 roco10]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0268636 roco11]).<br />Roco5 is localized to the cytosol and ''roco5'' expression is relatively constant throughout growth and development.

DDB_G0269130	Robert Dodson	''phgA'' encodes a Drainin, a member of the Rab-GTPase-TBC domain superfamily. Drainin lacks the conserved catalytic Arg and Gln residues required for Rab GTPase-activating protein (RabGAP) activity (Bos, et al 2007, PMID: 17540168) and does not exhibit rabGAP activity on any tested Rab GTPase: ([/gene/DDB_G0280043 rab8A]), ([/gene/DDB_G0269238 rab11A]), ([/gene/DDB_G0277101 rab11C]) and rab14 ([/gene/DDB_G0281337 rab14]) suggesting that Drainin is not a functional RabGAP ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18636095 Du et al. 2008]). ''phgA'' null cells are sensitive to hypo-osmotic stress and have enlarged contractile vacuoles which fail to discharge water because the vacuoles do not fuse with the plasma membrane ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10369671 Becker et al. 1999]). <br />Drainin, along with Disgorgin ([/gene/DDB_G0280955 dsgg]), Rab8A and Rab11A, functions in a signaling pathway to regulate CV fusion with the plasma membrane (PM) and subsequent CV discharge. Drainin binds strongly to constitutively active Rab GTPase Rab11A, and in response to hypo-osmotic stress, Rab11A is activated and recruits Drainin to the contractile vacuole membrane. Rab8a, the exocyst complex, and disgorgin then are sequentially recruited to the CV bladder, and the exocyst complex tethers the CV to the PM. Drainin also interacts ''in vivo'' with the exocyst complex subunit 6 (Sec15) ([/gene/DDB_G0293936 exoc6]). Drainin is enriched at the back of the CV bladder away from the bladder-PM contact site while Sec15 is localized to small patches at the bladder-PM contact site. In ''phgA'' null cells, Sec15 instead localized to a large area between the CV bladder and the PM, suggesting that the absence of Drainin leads to uncontrolled accumulation of the exocyst tethers and a block in CV discharge.

DDB_G0293012	Petra Fey	The CHD (chromodomain-helicase-DNA binding) protein family is one of the major ATP-dependent, chromatin remodeling factors that regulate nucleosome positioning and access of transcription factors and RNA polymerase to the eukaryotic genome. ''Dictyostelium discoideum'' contains three CHD orthologs (ChdA ([/gene/DDB_G0284171 chdA]), ChdB ([/gene/DDB_G0280705 chdB]) and ChdC) which are expressed throughout development, but with unique patterns. ''chdC'' has peak abundance between 8 and 10 hrs. of development. ''chdC'' null cells exhibited developmental arrest at the multicellular mound stage at approx. 12 hrs. and development failed to progress to the tipped mound stage. ''chdC'' null cells also displayed a reduced chemotaxis to cAMP, and the vegetative growth rate for ''chdC'' null cells was about half that of wt cells. Genome-wide (RNA-seq) transcriptome profiling for each CHD null strain revealed that the different CHDs regulate distinct gene sets during both growth and development. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24301467 Platt et al. 2013]). [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28330902 Platt et al. 2017] further demonstrated major nucleosome positional changes associated with developmental gene regulation in wild type cells. Loss of ''chdC'' caused an increase of nucleosome spacing in a large set of genes, and down regulation of developmental genes, affecting approximately 50 percent of the genes up-regulated in wild type during early development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28330902 Platt et al. 2017]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 28-JAN-2022 PF
DDB_G0281167	Petra Fey	DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) can be repaired by either non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR). In vertebrates, NHEJ is initated when Ku70/Ku80 heterodimers bind to DNA ends and recruit the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs). Homologs of these components in Dictyostelium are encoded by ''ku70'' ([/gene/DDB_G0286069 ku70]), ''ku80'' ([/gene/DDB_G0286303 ku80]),and ''dnapkcs'' ([/gene/DDB_G0281167 dnapkcs]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16243037  (Hudson et al. 2005)]. Both Ku70 and Ku80 are members of the family of ATP-dependent DNA helicases and are coordinately expressed during growth and early development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16112620  (Block and Lees-Miller, 2005)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887420  (Rosengarten et al. 2015)]. Poly ADP-ribose is generated by the polymerase Adprt1a ([/gene/DDB_G0278741 adprt1A]) at sites of DNA DSBs. Poly ADP-ribose polymers promote NHEJ by binding Ku70 at DSBs and attaching Ku80 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21807880  (Couto et al. 2011)]. Ku80 has a C-terminal domain that binds DNA-PKcs together with the homolog of the DNA repair endonuclease Artemis, Dclre1 ([/gene/DDB_G0277755 dclre1]), that is essential for NHEJ [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16112620  (Block and Lees-Miller, 2005)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16582628  (Hsu et al. 2006)]. Null mutations in either ''ku80'' or ''dnapkcs'' render recently germinated cells unusually sensitive to the DSB-inducing agent bleomycin. The ''dnapkcs'' null mutation renders H2AX ([/gene/DDB_G0279667 H2AX]) phosphorylation defective in response to this DNA damage. However, these mutations have no effect on bleomycin sensitivity in populations of growing cells, because DSBs can be repaired by the HR pathway in these cells with often two copies of each gene. Haploid cells emerge from spores in the G1 phase of the cell cycle where HR is inoperable; however, growing cells are in G2 where HR can compensate for loss of NHEJ [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16243037  (Hudson et al. 2005)]. The DNA joining events that result in integration of plasmid sequences at random sites of double-strand cleavage during REMI mutagenesis appear to depend on the NHEJ pathway, since ''ku70'', ''ku80'', ''adprt1a'' and ''dclre1'' null mutants do not show the increase in plasmid integration seen in wild type cells transformed together with restriction enzymes [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21807880  (Couto et al. 2011)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21536833  (Hsu et al. 2011)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 05-JAN-2019 RD; summary contribution: Bill Loomis
DDB_G0285969	Robert Dodson	''deeJ'' encodes DJ-1, an ortholog of human PARK7 which is associated with Parkinsons disease and which plays a role in cell protection against oxidative stress and cell death. DJ-1 belongs to the Class I glutamine amidotransferase-like superfamily, but its exact cellular function is unclear. ''Dictyostelium'' DJ-1 is localized in the cytoplasm. ''deeJ'' antisense mutants display decreased phagocytosis, decreased pinocytosis, and aberrant fruiting body morphology, with fruiting bodies that have larger sori and shorter, thicker stalks. In contrast, ''deeJ'' overexpression mutants have increased phagocytosis, increased pinocytosis, and an increased growth rate. Knockdown of DJ-1 also causes a small but significant activation of mitochondrial respiratory function, while overexpression inhibits mitochondrial activity, revealing that reduced levels of ''deeJ'' do not phenocopy mitochondrial dysfunction [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28819044  (Chen et al. 2017)].<br />Additional studies reveal that the combination of oxidative stress and knockdown of DJ-1 causes more severe phenotypic outcomes than either alone, and that the additional effects of oxidative stress in DJ-1 knockdown cells are dependent on AMPK ([/gene/DDB_G0277905 snfA]). In the absence of oxidative stress, ''deeJ'' antisense cells lack a phototaxis defect. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28819044  (Chen et al. 2017)]. However, during oxidative stress the accuracy of phototaxis is reduced in ''deeJ'' antisense cells and this phenotype is rescued in co-transformants in which expression of both DJ-1 and AMPK have been antisense-inhibited. In addition, AMPK knockdown in ''deeJ'' antisense cells rescued the cells from the additional effect of oxidative stress on phagocytosis rates, and substantially, but incompletely, rescued their growth defect. These results suggest that DJ-1 protects cells from the AMPK-mediated consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction arising from oxidative stress, and support a model in which, in the absence of oxidative stress, DJ-1 activates phagocytosis and pinocytosis and inhibits mitochondrial respiration, but under oxidative stress conditions DJ-1 also inhibits AMPK (Chen, et al 2021, PMID:34440642).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 18-FEB-2022 RD

DDB_G0273175	Petra Fey	Developing ''Dictyostelium'' cells aggregate to form fruiting bodies containing typically 2 x 10(4) cells. To prevent the formation of an excessively large fruiting body, streams of aggregating cells break up into groups if there are too many cells. The breakup is regulated by a secreted complex of polypeptides called counting factor (CF). CF is composed of 4 polypeptides, including Countin (encoded by the [/gene/DDB_G0274597 ctnA] gene), cf50, [/gene/DDB_G0269248 cf45-1] and [/gene/DDB_G0284363 cf60]. CF50 is 30% identical to lysozymes (but has very little lysozyme activity) and contains distinctive serine-glycine motifs. Transformants with a disrupted cf50 gene, like ''ctnA-'' cells, form abnormally large groups, exhibit increased levels of cytosolic glucose, increased cell-cell adhesion and decreased cell motility. CF50 is present in the same conditioned medium sieve column fraction as the 450 kDa CF complex. In the absence of CF50, secreted countin is degraded, suggesting that one function of CF50 may be to protect countin from degradation. However, unlike''ctnA-'' cells, ''cf50-'' cells differentiate into an abnormally high percentage of cells expressing [/gene/DDB_G0276761 cotB] (a marker expressed in a subset of prespore cells). Also unlike countin, addition of recombinant CF50 decreases the cAMP pulse following stimulation with cAMP. Countin and CF50 require each other's presence to affect group size, but the presence of countin is not necessary for CF50 to bind to cells, and CF50 is not necessary for countin to bind to cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12117815 Brock et al.2002], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12912898 Brock et al. 2003]).

DDB_G0286229	Petra Fey	AlyL belongs to the family of amoeba-type lysozymes, such as [/gene/DDB_G0275123 alyA], which has been shown to have lysozyme activity, and [/gene/DDB_G0275119 alyB], [/gene/DDB_G0275121 alyC]. ''alyD'', which is present in two copies on chromosome 2: [/gene/DDB_G0273197 alyD-1], [/gene/DDB_G0273731 alyD-2], and ''alyL'' are more distantly related to ''alyA'', ''alyB'', and ''alyC''. <br />In a genetic screen utilizing the growth of mutant amoebae on a variety of bacteria as a phenotypic readout, ''alyL'' has been identified to control growth on Gram-negative bacteria. AlyL has a signal peptide and likely resides in the lysosome or is otherwise secreted. ''alyL'' mutant cells grew poorly on all tested Gram-negative bacterial species such as ''Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa'', or ''E. coli B'', but grew well on Gram-positive bacteria such as ''Bacillus subtitles''. To test wether AlyL is required for feeding on bacteria or for defense against them, the ability to grow on dead Gram-negative cells has been tested. The ''alyL'' mutant cells grew well on the dead bacteria indicating that ''alyL'' is not required for nutritional requirement growing on Gram-negative bacteria, but likely for defense. AlyL, a putative lysozyme seems to fit this role as it is expressed during and required for growth on Gram-negative bacteria [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23664307 (Nasser et al. 2013)].<br />A comprehensive study classified all lysozymes in ''Dictyostelium''. In addition to the 5 known amoeba type lysozymes ([/gene/DDB_G0275123 alyA], [/gene/DDB_G0275119 alyB], [/gene/DDB_G0275121 alyC], [/gene/DDB_G0273197 alyD-1] and [/gene/DDB_G0286229 alyL] ), two new related lysozymes in this family have been identified, [/gene/DDB_G0282905 alyE] and [/gene/DDB_G0282893 alyF]. These genes are next to each other and almost identical, thus possibly a more recent gene duplication. In the past, gene models for these two new lysozymes gave rise to proteins with one or two transmembrane domains. Thus they first have been named alyTM1 and alyTM2, respectively. However, new sequence analyses resulted in updated gene models coding for proteins containing a signal peptide like the other 5 aly family members. Alignment of the 7 proteins allowed the identification of one conserved Asp and one Glu residue in the C- terminal portion of each protein, which might represent the amoeba lysozyme active site [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32061941 (Lamrabet et al. 2020)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 22-APR-2020 PF

The amino acid sequence of CF45-1 has some similarity to lysozymes, but recombinant CF45-1 has no detectable lysozyme activity. Disrupting the cf45-1 gene results in the formation of large groups when cells are grown with bacteria on agar plates and then starve. However, unlike ''ctnA-'' and ''cf50-'' cells, ''cf45-1-'' cells sometimes form smaller groups than wild-type cells when the cells are starved on filter pads. In the exudates from starved cells, CF45-1 is present in an about 450-kDa fraction that also contains countin and CF50, suggesting that it is part of a complex. Recombinant CF45-1 decreases group size in colonies of ''cf45-1-'' cells, as well as in colonies of wild-type and ''cf50-'' cells. Like ''ctnA-'' and ''cf50-'' cells, ''cf45-1-'' cells have high levels of cytosolic glucose, high cell-cell adhesion, and low cell motility. Together, the data suggest that CF45-1 participates in group size regulation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12912898 (Brock et al. 2003)].

DDB_G0286555	Robert Dodson	''racA'' encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Rho family of small GTPases. G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Ras GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. Possible RacGEFs for RacA include zizB ([/gene/DDB_G0293084 zizB]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22366457 Pakes et al. 2012]) and gxcDD ([/gene/DDB_G0279733 gxcDD]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17584488 Mondal et al. 2007]). GAPA ([/gene/DDB_G0269140 gapA]) is a possible racGAP for racA ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21085675 Mondal et al. 2010]). RacA has several binding partners that may function as downstream effectors, including the protein kinases PakA ([/gene/DDB_G0269166 pakA]) and PakC ([/gene/DDB_G0267450 pakC]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15470506 Park et al. 2004]), myosin heavy chain kinase PakB ([/gene/DDB_G0276459 pakB]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15509655 de la Roche et al. 2005]) and WASP ([/gene/DDB_G0293834 wasA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16968699 Han et al. 2006]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26940518 Rivero et al. 2016]).<br />''racA'' is an atypical member of the Rho GTPase family, belonging to the Rho BTB sub-family. The ''Dictyostelium'' RacA protein consists of an N-terminal GTPase domain followed by a short proline-rich domain, two consecutive BTB domains, and a conserved C-terminal domain. BTB domains are involved protein-protein interactions ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18298893 Berthold et al. 2008]). ''racA'' is weakly expressed throughout the life cycle with highest expression levels occuring during growth phase. Expression declines twofold at the onset of development but remains fairly constant thereafter ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8294042 Bush et al. 1993]). Expression of ''rasD'' is upregulated in response to intracellular ''Mycobacterium marinum'' infection ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31823727 Kjellin et al. 2019]). ''racA'' may be involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, although there are no published functional studies. Preliminary data on a ''racA'' null strain revealed a severe growth defect that is apparently not caused by impaired cytokinesis or endocytosis, suggesting an alteration of the cell cycle (F.

''gefH'' is expressed during both vegetative growth and development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16086850 Wilkins et al. 2005]). Chemoattractant-induced activation of RasC ([/gene/DDB_G0281385 rasC]) is decreased in ''gefH'' null cells, indicating that GefH has some GEF activity toward RasC. ''gefH'' null mutants also have directionality defects during chemotaxis to cAMP and reduced F-actin polymerization. In addition, ''gefH'' null mutants display a decrease in protein kinase B ([/gene/DDB_G0268620 pkbA]) activation. ''gefH'' is included within a Ras signaling complex, termed the Sca1 complex, which also includes an additional RasGEF GefA ([/gene/DDB_G0284329 gefA]), the protein phosphatase ([/gene/DDB_G0283601 pppA]), and a scaffold protein ([/gene/DDB_G0277843 scaA]). The Sca1 complex is recruited to the leading edge of chemo-taxing cells where it regulates F-actin dynamics and signal relay by controlling the activation of RasC and the downstream target of rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2)-Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) pathway and undergoes TORC2 and Akt/PKB-dependent negative feedback regulation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20493808 Charest et al. 2010]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 07-APR-2021 RD

''gefC'' has both Ras GEF and Rho GEF domains, as well as several several RCC1-like domains which suggests that it may function as a GEF for the small GTPase Ran ([/gene/DDB_G0291235 ranA]) and therefore might simultaneously modulate Rho, Ras, and Ran signaling ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26940518 Rivero et al. 2016]). ''gefC'' is expressed only in developing cells with expression starting at around 8 hours. ''gefC'' null cells display normal growth, morphology, development and phototaxis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16086850 Wilkins et al. 2005]). In addition, cAMP-stimulated RasC ([/gene/DDB_G0281385 rasC]) and RasG ([/gene/DDB_G0293434 rasG]) activation was normal in ''gefC'' null strains, indicating that GefC was not involved in the activation of either RasC or RasG during early development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17380187 Kae et al. 2007]). Confinement of Ras activation to a small area at the utmost front of the cell is also normal in ''gefC'' null cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23886948 Kortholt et al. 2013]).

''gefD'' is expressed throughout growth and development in AX3 cells, with maximal expression between 8 to 12 hours after starvation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16086850 Wilkins et al. 2005)]. cAMP-stimulated RasC ([/gene/DDB_G0281385 rasC]) and RasG ([/gene/DDB_G0293434 rasG]) activation was normal in ''gefD'' null strains, indicating that GefD was not involved in the activation of either RasC or RasG during early development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17380187 Kae et al. 2007]). ''gefD'' null cells exhibit normal growth, morphology, phototaxis and development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16086850 Wilkins et al. 2005)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17380187 Kae et al. 2007]). However, the confinement of Ras activation to the membrane region at the source of cAMP stimulus is abolished in both ''gefD'' and ''gefE'' ([/gene/DDB_G0269252 gefE]) null mutants, suggesting that ''gefD'' and ''gefE'' contribute to restrict activation of Ras to the front of chemotaxing cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23886948 Kortholt et al. 2013]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 25-MAR-2021 RD
DDB_G0277915	Robert Dodson	''gefI'' encodes a Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF, RasGEF). rasGEFs are key components of signaling networks in which they activate Ras family small GTPases by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP. ''gefI'' is expressed during both growth and development, with maximum expression at 12 hours of development. ''gefI'' and ''gefJ'' ([/gene/DDB_G0277913 gefJ]) are highly similar, suggesting that they arose from a relatively recent gene duplication ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16086850 Wilkins et al. 2005)]. A genome-wide DNA microarray analyses revealed that ''gefI'' expression is down-regulated during phagocytosis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18559084 Sillo, et al. 2008]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 13-APR-2021 RD
DDB_G0274607	Robert Dodson	''gefM'' encodes a Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF, RasGEF). rasGEFs are key components of signaling networks in which they activate Ras family small GTPases by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP. ''gefM'' is differentially expressed throughout growth and development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16086850 Wilkins et al. 2005)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16336640 Arigoni et al. 2005)]. ''gefM'' null mutant cells have multiple phenotypes. ''gefM'' null mutants are defective in development, forming small, flat aggregates that fail to develop further. Chemotaxis towards cAMP is also strongly impaired in the mutant cells, due to inability to inhibit lateral pseudopods. Both of these phenotypes are at least partially rescued by pulsing the cells with cAMP. The expression of genes involved in cAMP signaling and aggregation: adenylate cyclase A ([/gene/DDB_G0281545 acaA]), cAMP receptor 1 ([/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1], [/gene/DDB_G0273533 carA-2]) and contact site A protein ([/gene/DDB_G0289073 csaA]) is delayed in ''gefM'' null mutants. In addition, in ''gefM'' null mutants endogenous cAMP accumulates during early development to a much lower extent than in wild type. Adenylyl cyclase activation in response to cAMP pulses is strongly reduced, but guanylyl cyclase is stimulated to higher levels than in wild type. GefM is not an activator of either RasC ([/gene/DDB_G0281385 rasC]) or RasG ([/gene/DDB_G0293434 rasG]), and the target of its GEF activity remains unknown. These results indicate that ''gefM'' is involved in the establishment of the cAMP relay system, acting as positive regulator for adenylyl cyclase and negative regulator for guanylyl cyclase ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16336640 Arigoni et al. 2005)]. A genome-wide DNA microarray analysis revealed that ''gefM'' expression is down-regulated during phagocytosis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18559084 Sillo et al. 2008]). A co-immunoprecipitation assay revealed that GefM interacts with the adaptor protein FttB ([/gene/DDB_G0269138 fttB]), which is also involved in the regulation of cAMP signaling ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818671 Li et al. 2020)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 22-APR-2021 RD
DDB_G0274081	Robert Dodson	''gstA2'' encodes the enzyme glutathione S-transferase. Glutathione S-transferase plays an important role in cellular metabolism and detoxification by catalyzing the conjugation of glutathione to electrophilic endobiotic and xenobiotic substrates to reduce their interaction with cellular macromolecules. The plant polyphenol curcumin induces a significant increase in ''gstA2'' expression ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26449461 Garige et al. 2015]). ''gstA2'' is expressed in vegetatively growing cells. ''gstA2'' expression decreases during early development, but increases during slug and fruiting body formation. RNAi-mediated knockdown of ''gstA2'' results in decreased cell proliferation. In addition, ''gstA2'' knockdown cells have developmental abnormalities starting at the slug stage, including abnormally thick slugs which failed to form mature fruiting bodies at 24 hours of development. These results demonstrate that ''gstA2'' plays a role in proliferation and late stage development (Garige, et al 2021, PMID:33909675). Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 22-JUL-2021 RD
DDB_G0269298	Robert Dodson	''gefX'' encodes a protein with an amino-terminal serine/threonine protein kinase domain, and a RasGEF domain in the carboxyl-terminal region. This configuration of protein domains has been identified in a small number of proteins all classified as Amoebozoa and belonging to the RasGEF domain-containing serine/threonine protein kinase family (PTHR23257:SF718). ''gefX'' is expressed during both growth and development, with highest levels of expression between 8 and 12 hours of development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16086850 Wilkins et al. 2005)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 28-MAY-2021 RD
DDB_G0293920	Robert Dodson	The leucine-rich repeat domain-containing protein Leep1 was identified through a proteomic screen designed to identify proteins involved in the regulation of polarity. Leep1 localizes to the plasma membrane at the cell leading edge. In developing cells, Leep1 transiently redistributes to the cell periphery following both cAMP and folic acid stimulation. In vegetative-stage cells undergoing macropinocytosis, Leep1 is enriched at membrane patches that form macropinocytic cups. Leep1 is also associated with phagocytic cups. Leep1 associates with phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), which is responsible for recruiting Leep1 to the leading edge. ''leep1'' null mutants have a decreased rate of macropinocytosis and a reduction in the formation of macropinocytic cups. The mutant cells have an increased generation time when grown in liquid medium. Cell migration is only marginally affected in ''leep1'' null mutants, but the mutants generated fewer pseudopod splitting events compared with wild type cells, suggesting that ''leep1'' also plays a role in pseudopod dynamics. Overexpression of ''leep1'' results in increased filopodia formation and altered cytoskeletal rearrangement. Leep1 interacts with the Scar/WAVE complex, and both ScrA ([/gene/DDB_G0285253 scrA]) and PirA ([/gene/DDB_G0287855 pirA]) coimmunoprecipitate with Leep1. A ''leep1'' mutant with a truncated carboxyl-terminus does not interact with ScrA and also fails to promote increased filopodia formation, demonstrating that the ability to interact with the Scar complex underlies the cellular activity of Leep1. The similarity in phenotypes between overexpression of Leep1 and disruption of Scar implies that Leep1acts as a negative regulator of the Scar/WAVE complex in modulating leading edge dynamics.

DDB_G0275299	Robert Dodson	''Dictyostelium'' ''cln5'' is the ortholog of human CLN5, mutations in which cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), also referred to as Batten disease. ''cln5'' is expressed during growth with expression increasing during early development and reaching peak levels at 4 hours after starvation. From 4 to 8 hours, ''cln5'' expression decreases sharply and then remains constant during the remainder of development. Cln5 has glycoside hydrolase activity and localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum, punctate regions in the cytoplasm, and the cell cortex. Numerous potential Cln5 interacting proteins were identified by LC-MS-MS, including: NagA ([/gene/DDB_G0287033 nagA]), Tpp1 ([/gene/DDB_G0269914 tpp1]) and CtsD ([/gene/DDB_G0279411 ctsD]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29128403  (Huber et al. 2017)]. Glycosylated Cln5 is secreted during early development, with secretion occurring via an unconventional pathway linked to autophagy. Cln5 secretion is increased in ''cln3'' ([/gene/DDB_G0291157 cln3]) and ''mfsd8'' (''cln7'') ([/gene/DDB_G0272192 mfsd8]) null mutants. ''cln5'' null mutants have decreased cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion as well as decreased chemotaxis to cAMP [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30048658  (Huber et al. 2018)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32087303  (Huber et al. 2020)]. ''cln5'' null mutants display numerous defects during growth, including decreased proliferation, aberrant cytokinesis and decreased chemotaxis to folate. In addition, growth-phase ''cln5'' null cells display an increased number of autophagosomes, increased autophagic flux, and an increased number of ubiquitinated proteins. Development-stage ''cln5'' null cell defects include delayed aggregation, precocious late-stage development, aberrant spore morphology and decreased spore germination. Several of these growth and developmental defects are associated with aberrant autophagy, supporting evidence in other systems linking NCL to the autophagy pathway.

DDB_G0282581	Robert Dodson	Wdr45l belongs to a conserved group of proteins termed PROPPINs (beta-propeller that binds phosphoinositides) which are phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P)-binding proteins required for autophagosome biogenesis. ''wdr45l'' is similar to human WDR45, mutations in which cause Beta-Propeller Protein-Associated Neurodegeneration (BPAN). Wdr45l localizes to the autophagosome. ''wdr45l'' null mutants are unable to aggregate, have a severe growth defect and display a block in autophagy. In addition, ''wdr45l'' null mutants have phenotypes that are remarkably similar to those of ''vmp1'' ([/gene/DDB_G0285175 vmp1]) null mutant cells, including the abnormal enrichment of PtdIns3P at the autophagosome formation site, and a chronically activated endoplasmic reticulum stress response, suggesting that both proteins are involved in the regulation of autophagosome formation (Tornero-Ecija, et al 2021, PMID: 34328055).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 06-AUG-2021 RD
DDB_G0283629	Robert Dodson	''zntA'' was identified as a putative zinc transporter by sequence homology and a phylogenetic analysis placed ''zntA'' in a subfamily along with ([/gene/DDB_G0282067 zntB]), ([/gene/DDB_G0269332 zntC]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0291141 zntD]). All four genes are expressed in pstAB cells or at the stalk entrance during culmination, and both ''zntA'' and ''zntC'' are also expressed in pstAB cells in the slug stage. None of the four genes are expressed in a STATa ([/gene/DDB_G0281381 dstA]) null strain [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18415938  (Sunaga et al. 2008)]. ZntA localizes to the contractile vacuole, and, in a ''zntA'' null mutant, Zn2+ transport into the contractile vacuole is abolished. In addition, ''Escherichia coli'' is killed more rapidly in ''zntA'' null mutant cells than in wt, suggesting that accumulation of Zn2+ in phagolysosomes contributes to bacterial killing and that phagolysosomes contain a higher Zn2+ concentration in the ''zntA'' null strain that in wt [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30404827  (Barisch et al. 2018)]. During ''Mycobacterium marinum'' infection, both ZntA and ZntB localize to the Mycobacteria-containing vacuole (MCV), and expression of both genes is increased. In ''zntA'' null cells, MCVs accumulate more Zn2+ than wt cells, and intracellular ''M. marinum'' growth is decreased compared with wt cells, suggesting that ZntB, the main lysosomal and post-lysosomal Zn2+ transporter, might compensate for the absence of ZntA by exporting Zn2+ into all endosomes and MCVs. Taken together, these results suggest that ZntA is the main transporter for delivery of Zn2+ to the contractile vacuole and demonstrate that Zn2+ poisoning of bacteria is a killing strategy of ''Dictyostelium'' for invading bacteria (Hanna, et al. 2021, PMID:33531393).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 02-SEP-2021 RD
DDB_G0291239	Robert Dodson	In a screen of REMI transformants, ''ubpA'' was isolated as mutant with defective aggregation. ''ubpA'' encodes a protein with similarity to ubiquitin-specific processing proteases, which are involved in the regulation of protein degradation. UbpA was demonstrated to have deubiquitinase activity and to be a functional ortholog of ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' ubiquitin carboxyl terminal hydrolase UBP14. ''ubpA'' is expressed in both vegetative and development stage cells. Expression increases in early development reaching a maximum at 7.5 hours with continued expression throughout the remainder of development. UbpA is localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm throughout growth and development. ''ubpA'' mutant cells grow normally, but have several developmental defects, including impaired aggregation, chemotaxis, and cell-cell adhesion, as well as a decreased ability to relay a cAMP pulse. In addition, in ''ubpA'' mutant cells, the expression of aggregation-specific genes CarA ([/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1]) ([/gene/DDB_G0273533 carA-2]), PDE ([/gene/DDB_G0285995 pdsA]) and gp80 ([/gene/DDB_G0289073 csaA]) is decreased. These results suggest that developmental transitions in ''Dictyostelium'' require the degradation of specific proteins which in turn requires the disassembly of polyubiquitin chains by UbpA [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9786928  (Lindsey et al. 1998)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 23-SEP-2021 RD
DDB_G0268636	Robert Dodson	''roco11'' encodes a large, multi-domain protein of the Roco family. Roco11 contains an N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region, a Roc small GTPase domain, a COR (C-terminal of Roc) domain, and a protein kinase domain. Eleven ''Dictyostelium'' proteins belong to the Roco family: ([/gene/DDB_G0291079 gbpC]), ([/gene/DDB_G0273259 qkgA-1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0269250 pats1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0288251 roco4]), ([/gene/DDB_G0294533 roco5]), ([/gene/DDB_G0279417 roco6]), ([/gene/DDB_G0267472 roco7]), ([/gene/DDB_G0286127 roco8]), ([/gene/DDB_G0288183 roco9]), ([/gene/DDB_G0291710 roco10]) and Roco11. <br />Roco11 is localized to the cytosol and ''roco11'' is expressed during both growth and development with the highest level of expression during the slug stage of development. ''roco11'' null cells produce fruiting bodies with longer stalks than those of wt cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20348387 van Egmond and van Haastert 2010]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 25-OCT-2021 RD
DDB_G0267472	Robert Dodson	''roco7'' encodes a large, multi-domain protein of the Roco family. Roco7 contains a Roc small GTPase domain, a COR (C-terminal of Roc) domain, a protein kinase domain and a C-terminal WD40 repeat domain. ''roco7'' is an ortholog of human LRRK2, mutations in which are associated with Parkinson disease. Eleven ''Dictyostelium'' proteins belong to the Roco family: ([/gene/DDB_G0291079 gbpC]), ([/gene/DDB_G0273259 qkgA-1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0269250 pats1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0288251 roco4]), ([/gene/DDB_G0294533 roco5]), ([/gene/DDB_G0279417 roco6]), Roco7, ([/gene/DDB_G0286127 roco8]), ([/gene/DDB_G0288183 roco9]), ([/gene/DDB_G0291710 roco10]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0268636 roco11]).<br />Roco7 is localized to the cytosol and ''roco7'' is expressed during both growth and development with the highest level of expression during aggregation. Disruption of the ''roco7'' gene did not result in any significant developmental defects ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20348387 van Egmond and van Haastert 2010]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 15-OCT-2021 RD
DDB_G0278483	Robert Dodson	''ngaP'' encodes a Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP, rasGAP). RasGAPs are key components of signal transduction networks in which they inactivate Ras GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. ''ngap'' is expressed during development with highest expression at the cAMP chemotactic-competent stage. cAMP stimulation promotes an association between RasC ([/gene/DDB_G0281385 rasC]) and RasG ([/gene/DDB_G0293434 rasG]) and causes the transient translocation of Ngap from the cytosol to the leading edge membrane. Dominant negative RasC(S17N) or RasG(S17N) showed significantly reduced cAMP-mediated membrane translocation of NgaP, while constitutively active RasC(G12V) significantly enhanced the membrane translocation of NgaP, indicating that NgaP membrane localization is dependent on activated Ras. ''ngap'' null mutant cells have multiple phenotypes, including impaired aggregation, a decreased number of fruiting bodies, and a higher level of activated Ras. In response to persistent cAMP stimulation, ''ngap'' null mutants display the same initial, transient Ras activation as wild type (wt) cells, but fail to adapt persistently to the stimulation. In addition, ''ngap'' null cells have a chemotaxis defect, exhibiting poor directionality, decreased speed and a shorter travel path compared with wt cells at higher (10 microM) levels of cAMP, but normal chemotaxis at lower (100 nanoMolar) levels of cAMP. These results reveal that ''ngap'' null cells are unable to generate proper responses to cAMP gradients and indicate that NgaP is a negative regulator of Ras signaling required for adaptation and chemotaxis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29109256 Xu et al. 2017]). In the presence of high [Ca2+], there is a decreased membrane localization of NgaP. ''iplA'' null cells ([/gene/DDB_G0292564 iplA]), which lack a [Ca2+ ] increase in response to cAMP stimulation, displayed an increased, prolonged membrane translocation of NgaP, while ''cbpG'' ([/gene/DDB_G0283609 cbpG]) null cells with higher basal [Ca2+ ] levels upon cAMP stimulation exhibited little membrane translocation of NgaP, indicating that calcium negatively mediates the membrane targeting of NgaP. Further investigation of chemotactic response in a range of low cAMP concentrations revealed that ''ngap'' null cells display defective chemotaxis in high-concentration gradients but improved chemotaxis compared to wt cells in low- or sub-sensitive-concentration gradients (Xu, et al 2021, PMID: 34395450).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 01-OCT-2021 RD
DDB_G0282595	Robert Dodson	''gmfA'' encodes a protein of the ADF-H/Gelsolin-like domain superfamily. GmfA is widely conserved and is an ortholog of human Glia maturation factor gamma and yeast AIM7. GmfA isolated from ''Dictyostelium'' suppresses the activation of actin assembly by Arp2/3 complex (Nakano, et al. 2010, PMID:20517925). ''gmfA'' null cells have defects in growth, cytokinesis, and increased cell-substrate adhesion. Migrating ''gmfA'' null cells have a fan-like shape, and extend a single broad pseudopod that is almost three times as large as pseudopods of wild type (wt) cells. In addition, ''gmfA'' null cells form broken, disconnected aggregation streams and migrate with a higher persistency than wt cells. These results suggest that GmfA plays a role in the regulation of actin assembly and cell migration (Fujimoto, et al. 2021, PMID:34855306).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 09-DEC-2021 RD
DDB_G0269238	Robert Dodson	''rab11A'' encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Rab family of small GTPases. G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rab GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Rab GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. CnrF ([/gene/DDB_G0276119 cnrF]) displays GAP activity toward rab11A ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24335649 Parkinson, et al. 2013]). Disgorgin ([/gene/DDB_G0280955 dsgg]) exhibits weak GAP activity toward Rab11A. Drainin ([/gene/DDB_G0269130 phgA]) interacts with Rab11A in a GTP-dependent manner and serves as an effector of Rab11A. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18636095 Du et al. 2008]). ''rab11A'' is expressed at constant levels throughout growth and development and is associated with contractile vacuole complex membranes ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11686306 Harris et al. 2001]). Proteomic analysis reveals that Rab11A is also located in phagocytic vesicles ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16926386 Gotthardt, et al. 2006]), the Legionella-containing vacuole ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24373249 Hoffmann et al. 2013]), [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28183814  (Schmolders et al. 2017)], and ''M. marinum''-containing vacuoles (PMID:33531393; Hanna, ''et al.'' 2021). <br />''rab11A'' is involved in signaling networks that regulate contractile vacuole function. Dominant-negative Rab11A cells have altered contractile vacuole morphology and defective contractile vacuole function. Mutant cells are rounded with enlarged, swollen contractile vacuoles with some lysis of cells. There is also an enhanced rate of phagocytosis in Rab11A dominant-negative cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11686306 Harris et al. 2001]). Rab11A is activated in response to hypo-osmotic stress and recruits Drainin to the contractile vacuole membrane. Rab8A ([/gene/DDB_G0280043 rab8A]) and its Rab GAP disgorgin function downstream of drainin and rab11A to mediate contractile vacuole-plasma membrane fusion which is then followed by the discharge of water out of the cell ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18636095 Du, et al. 2008]). Rab11A is found in a complex with the ion channel receptor P2XA ([/gene/DDB_G0272004 p2xA]) and the calcium-regulated Rab GAP cnrF ([/gene/DDB_G0276119 cnrF]). Rab11A overexpressing cells display a phenotype similar to those of both ''p2xA'' and ''cnrF'' null cells: severe defects in hypo-osmotic response and large numbers of small vacuoles that fail to fuse with the plasma membrane. Both ''p2xA'' and ''cnrF'' null cells also contain higher levels of activated Rab11A, suggesting that P2XA inhibits Rab11A activity through the Rab GAP CnrF. These results suggest a model in which P2XA activation results in vacuolar calcium release, which triggers activation of CnrF Rab GAP activity and subsequent downregulation of Rab11a to allow vacuole fusion and contractile vacuole discharge ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24335649 Parkinson, et al. 2013]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 08-FEB-2021 RD
DDB_G0286351	Robert Dodson	A comparative phylogenetics analysis of ''cudA''-like genes ([/gene/DDB_G0284465 cudA]) in Dictyostelia revealed that two paralogous genes: ''cdl1A'' and ''cdl1B'' ([/gene/DDB_G0270306 cdl1B]) result from duplication of an ancestral ''cdl1'' gene. Expression of ''cdl1A'' and ''cdl1B'' is upregulated at 16 hours when migrating slugs have formed, with highest expression of both genes in pre-stalk cells. Cdl1A is also strongly expressed in slug tips. During culmination Cdl1A is expressed in the lower cup, and in mature fruiting bodies Cdl1A expression is almost completely confined to the upper and lower cup. ''cdl1A'' null mutants have fruiting bodies with an abnormal morphology, in which the spore mass cannot elevate to the top of the stalk. Expression of lacZ fused to the promotor of the cup-specific gene ''beiA'' ([/gene/DDB_G0276063 beiA]) in ''cdl1A'' null mutants revealed an almost complete lack of ''beiA'':lacZ expressing cells, suggesting a lack of cup cells in ''cdl1A'' mutants. High-throughput sequencing of RNAs from ''cdl1A'' null cells revealed that 135 genes were significantly under-expressed, and 35 genes were significantly over-expressed compared to wild type (wt) cells. Genes downregulated in ''cdl1A'' null mutants are mostly upregulated in wt and expressed in cup cells. Taken together, these results indicate that Cdl1A is a transcription factor that activates expression of genes essential for cup differentiation. ''cdl1A''/''cdl1B'' double null mutants develop normally until culmination, but then show severe defects in stalk formation. The cellulose stalk tube formed but with a disorganized arrangement of stalk cells inside the tubes, indicating that Cdl1a and Cdl1b are both required for proper stalk morphogenesis. Deletion of ''cdl1'' in an outgroup species, ''Polysphondylium violaceum'' also caused defects in stalk morphogenesis, suggesting that the ancestral function of ''cdl1'' in the Dictyostelia was stalk formation (Kin, et al. 2021, PMID:34883046).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 20-DEC-2021 RD
DDB_G0278311	Robert Dodson	Basic annotations have been added to this gene, 24-FEB-2022 RD
DDB_G0277777	Robert Dodson	''teep1'' was identified in a screen for pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing proteins exhibiting polarized distribution. Teep1 localizes to the trailing edge membrane of migrating, vegetative cells. In developing cells in response to cAMP stimulation, Teep1 transiently translocates from the plasma membrane to the cytosol. The localization pattern of Teep1 resembles that of Pten ([/gene/DDB_G0286557 pten]). Analysis of truncated ''teep1'' mutants reveal that the two N-terminal PH domains are responsible for targeting Teep1 to the rear of cells. Teep1 interacts with talin B ([/gene/DDB_G0287505 talB]) and binds to both phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) and phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2). Deletion of enzymes responsible for production of PI(4,5)P2 (PikI) ([/gene/DDB_G0267588 pikI]) and PI(3,5)P2 (PIKfyve) ([/gene/DDB_G0279149 pip5k3]) reduce the plasma membrane association of Teep1, indicating that PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,5)P2 regulate the posterior accumulation of Teep1 by jointly shaping the back state of the plasma membrane. In addition, the level of Teep1 associated with the plasma membrane is slightly increased in null cells of a myotubularin phosphatase, Mtm6 ([/gene/DDB_G0269272 mtm6]). Mtm6 localizes to the cell leading edge and is capable of degrading PI(3,5)P2, and likely mediates the removal of PI(3,5)P2 from the front and the formation of a reverse PI(3,5)P2 gradient. ''teep1'' null cells have a defect in cell motility and migrate at a significantly decreased speed compared with wt cells, but do not exhibit a defect in directed cell migration to either folic acid or cAMP.

DDB_G0284065	Robert Dodson	''rapgap9'' encodes a putative Rap GTPase-activating protein (GAP, rapGAP). RapGAPs are key components of signal transduction networks in which they inactivate Rap GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. ''rapgap9'' was identified in a bioinformatic search for Rap GAP domain proteins in ''Dictyostelium'' and RapGAP9 is an ortholog of human Rap1 GTPase-activating protein RAP1GAP2. Upon chemoattractant stimulation, RapGAP9 transiently and rapidly translocates to the cortex. ''rapgap9'' null cells are flatter and more spread out than wild type (wt) cells and are multinucleated, indicating a defect in cytokinesis. ''rapgap9'' null cells exhibit an aberrant F-actin polymerization profile with a slightly elevated basal level of F-actin and a proportionally elevated second peak compared with wild type cells which exhibit a sharp intial peak and a second lower, broader peak. ''rapgap9'' null cells display increased cell-substrate adhesion, extend an increased number of filopodia compared with wt cells, and also have a defect in chemotaxis to cAMP, displaying decreased speed and reduced directional movement compared with wt cells. In addition, ''rapgap9'' null cells have spores that are 40% smaller than wt cells. Taken together, these results suggest that RapGAP9 is involved in the regulation of cytokinesis, morphogenesis and development through controlling the reorganization of the cytoskeleton ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24513283 Mun et al. 2014]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 22-MAR-2021 RD; annotation contributions: PMID:24513283, Taeck Jeon

DDB_G0289479	Petra Fey	In eukaryotic cells, asparagine-linked glycolysation is one of the most common protein modification reactions, protein amino acid N-linked glycosylation, in the endoplasmic lumen. The protein complex responsible for these processes is the oligosaccharyltransferase complex (OST). The OST is an integral membrane complex that mediates the transfer of a preassembled high mannose oligosaccharide onto asparagine residues of nascent polypeptides. In yeast and vetebrates, the hetero-oligomeric proteins have 7 to 9 different subunits. The ''Dictyostelium'' complex contains 7 conserved subunits: [/gene/DDB_G0293224 ost1], [/gene/DDB_G0291049 ost2], [/gene/DDB_G0285537 ost3], [/gene/DDB_G0280609 ost4], [/gene/DDB_G0285159 stt3], [/gene/DDB_G0289479 swp1], and [/gene/DDB_G0291780 wbp1], all of which are putative integral membrane proteins of the ER; reviewed in [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16317064  Kelleher and Gilmore, 2005]. Another conserved OST subunit has been identified when improving a gene model, [/gene/DDB_G0306378 ostc].<br />A phenotypic readout, ''swp1'' has been identified to control growth on Gram-positive bacteria. ''swp1'' mutant cells grew poorly on all tested Gram-positive bacterial species such as ''Bacillus subtitles'' or ''Staphylococcus aureus'', but grew well on Gram-negative bacteria such as ''Klebsiella pneumoniae''. The ''swp1'' gene encodes a subunit of the oligosaccharyl transferase protein complex that catalyzes asparagine (N-linked) glycosylation of proteins. Tests blocking glycosylation in wild-type and comparing expression profiles with mutants suggest N-linked glycolsylation is required for growth on Gram-positive bacteria, but is dispensable for growth on Gram-negative bacteria.

DDB_G0275969	Robert Dodson	''rab1E'' encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Rab family of small GTPases. G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rab GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Rab GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. Rab1E is similar to human RAB1A and RAB1B, which are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 04-SEP-2020 RD

Rab subfamily small GTPases in many organisms are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking. Proteomic analysis revealed that Rab4 is localized to the Legionella-containing vacuole [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24373249  (Hoffmann et al. 2013)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 29-OCT-2020 RD
DDB_G0279191	Robert Dodson	''Dictyostelium discoideum'' contains three highly similar vacuolin genes: ([/gene/DDB_G0289485 vacA]), ''vacB'', and ([/gene/DDB_G0279307 vacC]). They share a domain structure similar to metazoan flotillins, with a central PHB-like domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil region. ''vacB'' mRNA is most strongly expressed in growing cells, but expression declines sharply during early development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9394012  (Jenne et al. 1998)]. Expression of ''vacB'' is upregulated in response to intracellular ''Mycobacterium marinum'' infection ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31823727 Kjellin et al. 2019]). All three vacuolins are tightly associated with membranes, and are recruited very early to phagosomes and steadily accumulate on post-lysososomes until exocytosis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9276759  (Rauchenberger et al. 1997]), [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16445684  (Peracino, et al. 2006]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32482795 Bosmani, et al. 2020]). <br />During infection by ''Mycobacterium marinum'', vacuolin B is essential for the establishment of the Mycobacteria-containing vacuole. Mycobacterial proliferation is decreased in ''vacB'' null cells, and the cells are overall more resistant to infection ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17587329 Hagedorn, et al. 2007]). ''vacB'' null mutants also have a severe defect in phagocytosis, and a ''vacA''/''vacB''/''vacC'' triple null mutant revealed that the phagocytic defect results from impaired particle recognition. ''vacA''/''vacB''/''vacC'' mutants also have defects in plasma membrane protein recycling, decreased cell surface adhesion, and a more rapid phagosome maturation. In addition, ([/gene/DDB_G0274455 myoI]) (MyoVII) and ([/gene/DDB_G0290481 talA]) gene expression and protein levels are reduced in ''vacA''/''vacB''/''vacC'' mutants, and MyoVII expression rescues the adhesion, particle uptake and surface protein recycling phenotypes in these mutants. These results suggest that the absence of MyoVII and TalA are responsible for the uptake defects observed in vacuolin knockout mutants, and lead to the proposal that vacuolins stabilize the MyoVII/TalA complex formed at specific areas of the phagocytic cup and early endocytic compartments ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32482795 Bosmani, et al. 2020]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated 03-NOV-2020 RD
DDB_G0282537	Robert Dodson	''rabS'' encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Rab family of small GTPases. G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rab GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Rab GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. Rab2A is associated with both the Golgi membrane and the contractile vacuole system ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27240981 Maringer et al. 2016)] and dominant-negative (DN) Rab2A cells also localize to lysosomes and endosomes ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29843387 Yarbrough, et al. 2018]). A genome-wide DNA microarray analysis revealed that ''rabS'' expression is down-regulated in response to ''Pseudomas aeruginosa'' expression ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18590548 Carilla-Latorre, et al. 2008]).<br />''rabS'' is involved in signaling networks that regulate contractile vacuole function and response to osmotic stress, development, endocytosis, and the secretion of lysosomal enzymes. Similar to ''rab2A'' ([/gene/DDB_G0292268 rab2A]) DN cells, ''rabS'' DN cells lack contractile vacuoles. ''rabS'' and ''rab2A'' over-expressing (OE) and mutant cell lines show defects in osmoregulation indicating that both genes are involved in the regulation of cellular response to osmotic stress ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27240981 Maringer, et al. 2016]). Cells over-expressing ''rabS'' showed an increase in the rate of both phagocytosis and pinocytosis with a corresponding increase in growth rate. These cells also showed a significant increase in cell mortality. Aggregation is severely defective in ''rabS'' OE cells as these cells have decreased cell-cell adhesion and chemotactic response to cAMP. ''rabS'' OE cells are also unable to complete development and could not form fruiting bodies. Dominant negative ''rabS'' cells display increased endocytic recycling and both OE and DN ''rabS'' cell lines over-secreted lysosomal glycosidase enzymes, especially beta-glucosidase ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29843387 Yarbrough, et al. 2018]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 02-FEB-2021 RD

DDB_G0280975	Robert Dodson	''racE'' encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Rho family of small GTPases. G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Ras GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. GxcC ([/gene/DDB_G0284845 gxcC]) is a likely GEF for RacE ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23363311 Plak et al. 2013]). GxcT ([/gene/DDB_G0269610 gxcT]) binds to and may also activate RacE ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24248334 Wang et al. 2013]). The armadillo-like protein Darlin ([/gene/DDB_G0288771 darA]) binds RacE, but a GEF activity has not been demonstrated ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9802899 Vithalani et al. 1998]). Other possible GEFs for RacE include GxcDD ([/gene/DDB_G0279733 gxcDD]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17584488 Mondal et al. 2007]) and DockD ([/gene/DDB_G0284725 docD]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27009206 Senoo et al. 2016]). DRG ([/gene/DDB_G0291978 xacA]) is a GAP for RacE ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11285226 Manstein et al. 2001]). GflB ([/gene/DDB_G0286773 gflB]) has both ras GEF and rho GAP domains, and it functions as a GAP for RacE ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27009206 Senoo et al. 2016]). DGAP1 ''rgaA'' ([/gene/DDB_G0287585 rgaA]) is also a possible GAP for RacE ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9739079 Faix et al. 1998]).<br />RacE has multiple binding partners that function as downstream effectors. RacE interacts with formin A ([/gene/DDB_G0279607 forA]), formin E ([/gene/DDB_G0269626 forE]), and formin H ([/gene/DDB_G0285589 forH]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30808751 Litschko et al. 2019]). GDP-bound RacE binds to the tor complex components tor ([/gene/DDB_G0281569 tor]) and pia ([/gene/DDB_G0277399 piaA]), and GDP-bound RacE binds to activated, GTP-bound ''rasC'' ([/gene/DDB_G0281385 rasC]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31263268 Senoo et al. 2019]). RacE also binds to PakB ([/gene/DDB_G0276459 pakB]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15509655 de la Roche et al. 2005]) and the Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor RhoGDI1 ([/gene/DDB_G0291077 rdiA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12163018 Imai et al. 2002]). <br />''racE'' plays an important role in signaling networks that regulate cytokinesis, chemotaxis, and organization of the cortical cytoskeleton to maintain proper cortical integrity ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26940518 Rivero et al. 2016)]. ''racE'' null cells are multi-nucleate and unable to divide when grown in suspension, however cytokinesis is normal in ''racE'' null cells grown on a substrate ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8682867 Larochelle et al. 1996]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9368749 Chisholm 1997]). Abnormal F-actin aggregates form in ''racE'' null mutants and the cells display decreased cortical tension, which is the likely cause of ''racE'' cytokinesis defects ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9548725 Gerald et al. 1998]). RacE is required for the localization of several proteins to the cell cortex. In ''racE'' null cells, three cytoskeletal components essential for cytokinesis: dynacortin ([/gene/DDB_G0283767 dct]), coronin A ([/gene/DDB_G0267382 corA]), and 14-3-3 ([/gene/DDB_G0269138 fttB]) all fail to localize to the cell cortex ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10953006 Robinson et al. 2000]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20951045 Zhou et al. 2010]). In addition, formin A ([/gene/DDB_G0279607 forA]) fails to localize to the cortex in ''racE'' nulls. Activated RacE localizes to the rear cortex of cells as do the RacE effectors formin A, formin E ([/gene/DDB_G0269626 forE]), and formin H ([/gene/DDB_G0285589 forH]). A ''forA''/''forE''/''forH'' triple null mutant displays nearly identical phenotypes as the ''racE'' null mutant ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30808751 Litschko et al. 2019]). ''racE'' null cells also have a defect in chemotaxis to cAMP, impaired growth on bacterial lawns, and fail to aggregate normally during development. In cells lacking RacE or the RacGEF GxcT ([/gene/DDB_G0269610 gxcT]), the accuracy of directional sensing is reduced, and pseudopods are abnormally extended from the lateral sides of migrating cells resulting in impaired chemotaxis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24248334 Wang et al. 2013]). GflB is required for both chemotaxis to cAMP and cytokinesis, and GflB activates RasG ([/gene/DDB_G0293434 rasG]) and also inactivates RacE. As RacE and RasG ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10725225 Khosla et al. 2000]) also function in cytokinesis, GflB may coordinate signal transduction of RacE and RasG for both chemotaxis and cytokinesis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27009206 Senoo et al. 2016]). <br />RacE occupies a unique position as a signaling molecule in cell migration by connecting GPCR activation to mTORC2-AKT signaling. Chemoattractant-induced phosphorylation of GDP-RacE by glycogen synthase kinase GSK-3 ([/gene/DDB_G0272110 gskA]) promotes its hetero-oligomerization with GTP-RasC. At the front of migrating cells, GDP-RacE-GTP-RasC hetero-oligomers directly activate mTORC2 signaling and AKT/PKB ([/gene/DDB_G0268620 pkbA]) phosphorylation to then regulate the actin cytoskeleton and cell migration. GTP-bound RacE localizes to the rear of migrating cells where it antagonizes mTORC2-AKT signaling by inhibiting the oligomerization of GDP-RacE with GTP-RasC. Thus RacE plays two opposite roles at two different intracellular locations to polarize the actin cytoskeleton in migrating cells: GDP-RacE activates mTORC2-AKT signaling at the front of migrating cells while GTP-RacE inhibits signaling at the rear of migrating cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31263268 Senoo et al. 2019)], Senoo ''et al.'' 2020, PMID: 33238110.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 11-MAR-2021 RD

G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs, rasGEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs, rasGAPs) inactivate Ras GTPases. The similarity in phenotypes of ''rasS'' and RasGEF B ([/gene/DDB_G0269222 gefB]) null mutants suggests that RasS is activated by RasGEF B ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11102804 Wilkins et al. 2000)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12854977 King and Insall et al. 2003)]. RasS interacts with the protein kinase Phg2 ([/gene/DDB_G0283699 phg2]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15194808 Gebbie et al. 2004)] and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases pikA, ([/gene/DDB_G0278727 pikA]), pikB ([/gene/DDB_G0283081 pikB]) and pikF ([/gene/DDB_G0268548 pikF]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23843627 Hoeller et al. 2013)] suggesting that these kinases may be downstream effectors of RasS.<br />''rasS'' is expressed during vegetative growth ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10652263 Chubb et al. 2000)] with maximum levels detected during aggregation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8290260 Daniel et al. 1994)]. ''rasS'' null mutants from a DH1 background are highly polarized and display altered F-actin cytoskeleton organization. They also have severe defects in growth and macropinocytosis, a reduced rate of phagocytosis, and a higher rate of cell motility during growth ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10652263 Chubb et al. 2000)]. However, ''rasS'' null cells from an AX2 background have opposite phenotypes-decreased cell motility and cell polarity ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16822579 Pollitt et al. 2006)], no defect in the rate of macropinocytosis but decreased macropinosome formation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967009 Williams et al. 2019)]. ''rasS'' null strains created in a non-axenic Ddb strain background have modestly increased cell motility and decreased macropinocytosis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29847546 Paschke et al. 2018)]. Expression of constitutively active mutants of both RasS and RasG ([/gene/DDB_G0293434 rasG]) in a non-axenic Ddb background causes fluid uptake to more than double ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967009 Williams et al. 2019)]. In addition, fluid uptake is more strongly reduced in ''rasG''/''rasS'' double null mutants than in ''rasG'' single null mutants, suggesting that RasS and RasG ([/gene/DDB_G0293434 rasG]) are the key Ras proteins involved in macropinocytosis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967009 Williams et al. 2019)]. Taken together, these results suggest that RasS is a positive effector of macropinocytosis and a negative effector of cell movement.

DDB_G0288977	Robert Dodson	''iqgC'' encodes a Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP, rasGAP). RasGAPs are key components of signal transduction networks in which they inactivate Ras GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. The IQGAP-related protein IqgC contains a Ras GTPase-activating (RasGAP) domain and localizes to macropinosomes and phagosomes. Yeast two-hybrid assay revealed a direct interaction with the active, GTP-bound Ras GTPase RasG ([/gene/DDB_G0293434 rasG]) and IqgC promoted GTPase activity of RasG, confirming that it is a RasGTPase-activating protein that suppresses RasG signaling. ''iqgC'' null cells display an increased rate of macropinocytosis and a slight increase in the size of macropinosomes. ''iqgC'' null cells also have a mild cytokinesis defect and are more efficient in the uptake of both bacteria and yeast than wt cells. These results reveal a role for ''iqgC'' as a negative regulator of macropinocytosis and phagocytosis.

DDB_G0293918	Robert Dodson	Telomerase reverse transcriptase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme responsible for telomere maintenance in most eukaryotes. Dictyostelium ''tert'' shares 22% identity with human TERT, but contains a Poly A stretch within the catalytic domain that could impair enzymatic activity. The expression level of the ''tert'' gene appears to be extremely low (MacWilliams, pers. communication). A telomerase activity assay did not detect telomerase activity in cell extracts, and ''tert'' null cells displayed developmental defects suggesting a non-canonical role for Tert in ''Dictyostelium'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31237867 Nassir, et al. 2019]). Several genes involved in DNA recombination: ([/gene/DDB_G0292786 rad50]), ([/gene/DDB_G0273139 rad51-1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0273611 rad51-2]), ([/gene/DDB_G0288993 smc6]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0293546 mre11]) are upregulated in ''tert'' null cells, suggesting that a mechanism of telomere extension other than telomere elongation by telomerase may be used in ''Dictyostelium''. However, a putative telomerase activity was detected, and ''tert'' null strains have a modified telomere structure, indicating that ''tert'' is involved in telomere maintenance.

DDB_G0273635	Robert Dodson	QkgA (Roco2) contains an N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motif similar to that of human LRRK2, in addition to the Roc (Ras-like), COR, and kinase domains present in eukaryotic Roco proteins. Eleven ''Dictyostelium'' proteins belong to the Roco family: [/gene/DDB_G0291079 gbpC], [/gene/DDB_G0273259 qkgA-1], [/gene/DDB_G0269250 pats1], [/gene/DDB_G0288251 roco4], [/gene/DDB_G0294533 roco5], [/gene/DDB_G0279417 roco6], [/gene/DDB_G0267472 roco7], [/gene/DDB_G0286127 roco8], [/gene/DDB_G0288183 roco9], [/gene/DDB_G0291710 roco10], and [/gene/DDB_G0268636 roco11]. Disruption of ''qkgA'' causes a marked increase in growth rate, indicating a role in the negative regulation of cell proliferation, and aggregation occurs relatively slowly resulting in abnormally large multicellular structures ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12954783 Abe et al. 2003]). QkgA is involved in a signal transduction network through the autocrine proliferation repressor AprA ([/gene/DDB_G0281663 aprA]). Similar to ''aprA'' and counting factor associated protein CfaD ([/gene/DDB_G0281605 cfaD]) null mutants, ''qkgA'' null cells proliferate to a higher cell density than wild type cells and tend to be multinucleate. In addition, ''qkgA'' null cells are insensitive to exogenous AprA and CfaD, indicating that QkgA is required for AprA and CfaD-mediated inhibition of proliferation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20709790 Phillips and Gomer, 2010]). Wild-type cells adjacent to a source of recombinant AprA (rAprA) showed a significant bias in displacement away from rApA, whereas G protein alpha 8 ([/gene/DDB_G0284469 gpaH]), ''qkgA'', and ''cfaD'' null cells did not. These results indicate that AprA also functions as a chemorepellent, and that that Galpha8, QkgA, and CfaD are necessary for the chemorepellant effect of AprA ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22711818 Phillips and Gomer, 2012]).<br />''qkgA'' is a key regulator of the actin cytoskeleton during chemotaxis. QkgA is activated in response to chemoattractant stimulation, localizes to the pseudopodium, and binds to both the rab family GTPase ([/gene/DDB_G0283757 rab1A]) and filamin ([/gene/DDB_G0269100 abpC]). Constitutively active Rab1A pulls down 5 x more Roco2 than wild type Rab1A while dominant-negative Rab1A fails to interact with it, suggesting that activated Rab1A positively regulates Roco2 activity. ''qkgA'' null cells have defects in cell motility and chemotaxis to cAMP, aggregation and cytokinesis. ''qkgA'' null cells also display decreased chemoattractant-mediated F-actin polymerization. These results reveal a signal transduction pathway in which Rab1A activates Roco2 kinase which in turn mediates cell polarization and chemotaxis by regulating cortical F-actin polymerization and pseudopod extension. A major function of Roco2 is to stabilize the nascent pseudopod and enhance F-actin polymerization, in part through its downstream effector filamin ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21551065 Kicka et al. 2011]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-OCT-2020 RD
DDB_G0273259	Robert Dodson	QkgA (Roco2) contains an N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motif similar to that of human LRRK2, in addition to the Roc (Ras-like), COR, and kinase domains present in eukaryotic Roco proteins. Eleven ''Dictyostelium'' proteins belong to the Roco family: [/gene/DDB_G0291079 gbpC], [/gene/DDB_G0273259 qkgA-1], [/gene/DDB_G0269250 pats1], [/gene/DDB_G0288251 roco4], [/gene/DDB_G0294533 roco5], [/gene/DDB_G0279417 roco6], [/gene/DDB_G0267472 roco7], [/gene/DDB_G0286127 roco8], [/gene/DDB_G0288183 roco9], [/gene/DDB_G0291710 roco10], and [/gene/DDB_G0268636 roco11]. Disruption of ''qkgA'' causes a marked increase in growth rate, indicating a role in the negative regulation of cell proliferation, and aggregation occurs relatively slowly resulting in abnormally large multicellular structures ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12954783 Abe et al. 2003]). QkgA is involved in a signal transduction network through the autocrine proliferation repressor AprA ([/gene/DDB_G0281663 aprA]). Similar to ''aprA'' and counting factor associated protein CfaD ([/gene/DDB_G0281605 cfaD]) null mutants, ''qkgA'' null cells proliferate to a higher cell density than wild type cells and tend to be multinucleate. In addition, ''qkgA'' null cells are insensitive to exogenous AprA and CfaD, indicating that QkgA is required for AprA and CfaD-mediated inhibition of proliferation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20709790 Phillips and Gomer, 2010]). Wild-type cells adjacent to a source of recombinant AprA (rAprA) showed a significant bias in displacement away from rApA, whereas G protein alpha 8 ([/gene/DDB_G0284469 gpaH]), ''qkgA'', and ''cfaD'' null cells did not. These results indicate that AprA also functions as a chemorepellent, and that that Galpha8, QkgA, and CfaD are necessary for the chemorepellant effect of AprA ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22711818 Phillips and Gomer, 2012]).<br />''qkgA'' is a key regulator of the actin cytoskeleton during chemotaxis. QkgA is activated in response to chemoattractant stimulation, localizes to the pseudopodium, and binds to both the rab family GTPase ([/gene/DDB_G0283757 rab1A]) and filamin ([/gene/DDB_G0269100 abpC]). Constitutively active Rab1A pulls down 5 x more Roco2 than wild type Rab1A while dominant-negative Rab1A fails to interact with it, suggesting that activated Rab1A positively regulates Roco2 activity. ''qkgA'' null cells have defects in cell motility and chemotaxis to cAMP, aggregation and cytokinesis. ''qkgA'' null cells also display decreased chemoattractant-mediated F-actin polymerization. These results reveal a signal transduction pathway in which Rab1A activates Roco2 kinase which in turn mediates cell polarization and chemotaxis by regulating cortical F-actin polymerization and pseudopod extension. A major function of Roco2 is to stabilize the nascent pseudopod and enhance F-actin polymerization, in part through its downstream effector filamin ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21551065 Kicka et al. 2011]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-OCT-2020 RD
DDB_G0269138	Robert Dodson	14-3-3 proteins are a group of well-conserved adaptor proteins that form dimers and bind to phosphorylated serine/threonine residues on target proteins. 14-3-3 proteins are involved in the regulation of signaling pathways. ''fttB'' is the sole 14-3-3 related gene in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome. Highest levels of ''fttB'' expression are observed in vegetative cells with decreased expression during development; however FttB protein levels remain constant during development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9223628 Knetsch et al. 1997]). FttB is found in the cytosol ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818671 Li et al. 2020]), is enriched at the cell cortex ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20951045 Zhou et al. 2010]), and is localized to the centrosome during cytokinesis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25298405 Plak et al. 2014]). FttB interacts with numerous proteins, including the ankyrin repeat-containing protein kinase A ([/gene/DDB_G0289555 arkA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14597204 Aubry et al. 2003]) the TOR complex 2 protein PiaA ([/gene/DDB_G0277399 piaA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16079174 Lee et al. 2005]) and the SH2 domain protein LrrB ([/gene/DDB_G0287823 lrrB]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20457612 Sugden et al. 2010]).<br />In ''Dictyostelium'' FttB coordinates three major cytoskeletal elements: microtubules, actin, and myosin II-to control two critical processes, cytokinesis and cortical mechanics ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20951045 Zhou et al. 2010]). In addition, FttB plays a role in cAMP signaling during development and contributes to the regulation of chemotaxis to cAMP and tip formation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818671 Li et al. 2020]). Down-regulated FttB cells have a slower growth rate and are multi-nucleated and have an altered cleavage furrow morphology, indicating a cytokinesis defect. The cells also have a defect in cytoskeleton organization with shorter microtubules and decreased cortical tension ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20951045 Zhou et al. 2010]). Down-regulated FttB cells also have defects in chemotaxis to cAMP and form mounds with multiple tips ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818671 Li et al. 2020]). FttB fails to localize to the cell cortex in ''racE'' null cells ([/gene/DDB_G0280975 racE]) and over-expression of FttB partially rescues the mechanical defect in ''racE'' null cells, suggesting that FttB functions downstream of RacE to regulate the cell cortex and cytokinesis. FttB also interacts with the myosin II heavy chain ([/gene/DDB_G0286355 mhcA]) to regulate its distribution and assembly ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20951045 Zhou et al. 2010]). Large scale immunoprecipitation identified 100 proteins that potentially interact with FttB, including the protein kinases PakA ([/gene/DDB_G0269166 pakA]) and Fray1 ([/gene/DDB_G0278863 fray1]), and the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RasGEFs) GefM ([/gene/DDB_G0274607 gefM]) and GefQ ([/gene/DDB_G0289665 gefQ]). FttB binding to GefQ regulates tip formation through the Ras GTPase RasB ([/gene/DDB_G0292998 rasB]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818671 Li et al. 2020]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 16-DEC-2020 RD
DDB_G0286557	Robert Dodson	The concentration of membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), is higher at the front of cells in a chemotactic gradient than at the back ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12802064 Huang et al. 2003)]. Not only is PIP3 synthesized more rapidly at the front, it is also converted to PIP2 less rapidly at the front of cells than at the back. The conversion of PIP3 to PIP2 is catalyzed by the PIP3 3' phosphatase encoded by ''pten'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12062103 Ijima and Devreotes 2002)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12062104 Funamoto et al. 2002)]. PTEN binds to PIP2 in the membrane to position itself near its substrate ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25448479 Yang et al. 2014)]. Exposing cells to a gradient of cAMP results in rapid release of PTEN from the membrane followed by return of PTEN to the membrane at the rear and the sides. Cells lacking PTEN migrate poorly because they extend multiple spiky pseudopods in all directions and fail to suppress lateral pseudopods ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12062103 Ijima and Devreotes 2002)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17623773 Wessels et al. 2007)]. Disruption of the protein kinase PKB ([/gene/DDB_G0268620 pkbA]) restores polarity to cells lacking PTEN ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21169559 Tang et al. 2010)] indicating that high PIP3 levels affect the cytoskeleton largely by excessive stimulation of PKB activity and phosphorylation of its substrates. Cells that are unable to generate gradients in PIP3 because of knock-out mutations in the genes for all 5 type-1 PI3 kinases ([/gene/DDB_G0278727 pikA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0283081 pikB]), ([/gene/DDB_G0275011 pikC]), ([/gene/DDB_G0268548 pikF]), ([/gene/DDB_G0282625 pikG]), as well as in pten, move more slowly than wild type cells but are still able to navigate up a strong gradient of chemoattractant ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17462897 Hoeller and Kay 2007)]. PIP3 negatively regulates Pten membrane localization, with mutual inhibition between PIP3 and PTEN leading to a a clear spatial separation between PIP3 and Pten on the membrane ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30367048 Matsuoka et al. 2018]). Pten is involved in the signal transduction pathway responsible for AprA-dependent ([/gene/DDB_G0281663 aprA]) chemorepulsion.

DDB_G0290783	Robert Dodson	''rabG2'' encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Rab family of small GTPases. G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rab GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Rab GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP.

DDB_G0285253	Robert Dodson	''scrA'' was isolated as a suppressor of the [/gene/DDB_G0288179 carB] phenotype, developmental arrest at the mound stage. SCAR orthologs exist in mammals, flies, fish, but not in yeasts, plants, or in bacteria. Scar is part of the SCAR complex consisting of [/gene/DDB_G0285253 scrA], [/gene/DDB_G0267956 abiA], [/gene/DDB_G0279175 hspc300], [/gene/DDB_G0287855 pirA], and [/gene/DDB_G0274519 napA] and involved in positive regulation of actin filament polymerization. The first 96 amino acids of ScrA are necessary for interaction with [/gene/DDB_G0267956 abiA] and [/gene/DDB_G0279175 hspc300]. This interaction is essential for SCAR complex function as the deletion of the amino terminus in ''scrA'' causes defects in chemotaxis to cAMP and cytokinesis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17314411 Caracino et al. 2007]).<br />''scrA'' null mutants grow at normal rates but are smaller in size than normal wild type. The cytoskeleton is aberrant in ''scrA''- cells: there is decreased levels of filamentous actin, suggesting a role for SCAR in positive regulation of actin filament polymerization. Moreover, these cells are less polarized during aggregation and have an increased tendency to for lateral pseudopods. ''scrA'' null develops approximately 3 hours faster than wild type cells and form multiple tips. Each tip forms an individual slug and a relatively normal fruiting body ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9732292 Bear et al. 1998]).<br />[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11683394 Seastone et al. 2001] demonstrated that rates of fluid phase macropinocytosis and phagocytosis are significantly reduced in ''scrA'' null cells. In addition, fluid phase exocytosis is delayed and movement of the fluid phase from lysosomes to post-lysosomes is also delayed. Furthermore, deletion of ''scrA'' in the profilin null background resulted in a further decrease in endocytosis and fluid phase release compared to either mutant alone, suggesting that profilin and SCAR both functionally contribute to regulate fluid phase endocytosis and endosomal membrane trafficking.<br />SCAR/WAVE is activated during mitosis and localizes to the cell poles, driving the separation of daughter cells. SCAR activity was shown to be essential for myosin-independent cytokinesis, stabilizing the cleavage furrow and thus ensuring symmetrical cell division. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20530573 King et al. 2010]).<br />Results from unphosphorylatable and phosphomimetic ''scrA'' mutants revealed that dephosphorylation of SCAR controls normal pseudopod dynamics ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22386315 Ura et al. 2012]). <br />In wild type cells, SCAR recruitment occurs in patches of activated Rac. This causes Arp2/3 recruitment and pseudopod formation but also (directly or indirectly) results in Rac1 inactivation. When SCAR function is lost, by deletion of the ''scrA'' gene or any regulatory members of the SCAR complex, this Rac inactivation no longer occurs, and the level of activated Rac increases. When the level of activated Rac becomes high enough, WASP ([/gene/DDB_G0293834 wasA]) is recruited through its CRIB domain and thus effectively replaces the functions of SCAR ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22891261 Veltman et al. 2012]).<br />''scrA'' is involved in the signal transduction pathway responsible for AprA-dependent ([/gene/DDB_G0281663 aprA]) chemorepulsion. AprA requires ScrA to activate Ras at the cell cortex ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30462573 Rijal et al. 2018]). <br />The sepA kinase ([/gene/DDB_G0276465 sepA]) interacts with the Scar complex and phosphorylates Scar's proline-rich domain after the complex is activated. Phosphorylation-deficient or phosphomimetic Scar/WAVE mutants are both normally functional and rescue the phenotype of ''scrA'' null cells, demonstrating that phosphorylation is dispensable for Scar activation. Cell-substrate adhesion induces Scar phosphorylation. Normal Scar activation in talA/talB ([/gene/DDB_G0290481 talA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0287505 talB]) double mutant cells forced into adhesion suggest that pseudopod engagement with the substratum is more important than extracellular signals at regulating Scar activity and that phosphorylation acts as a pseudopod timer by promoting Scar turnover ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32745097 Singh et al. 2020]) <br />''scrA'' mRNA is expressed maximally at the aggregation stage.

DDB_G0269160	Robert Dodson	Annexins are evolutionarily conserved calcium/phospholipid binding proteins consisting of a core domain made up of tandem repeats, of approximately 70 residues. ''nxnA'' is homologous to human ANXA7, and encodes annexin VII, one of two annexin genes in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome. ''nxnA'' mRNA is expressed during both growth and development, with the level of ''nxnA'' mRNA increasing 5 fold during development and reaching a peak at approximately 16 hrs. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1832674 Doring et al. 1991]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1826615 Greenwood et al. 1991]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7862106 Bonfils et al. 1994]). Annexin VII (NxnA) localizes to the plasma membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7657724 Doring et al. 1995]). Proteomic analyses reveal that NxnA also localizes to the phagosome ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16926386 Gotthardt et al. 2006]) and to Legionella-containing phagosomes ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19482547 Shevchuk et al. 2009]). Annexin VII binds to phosphatidylserine in a calcium ion-dependent manner ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1824843 Gerke et al. 1991]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7862106 Bonfils et al. 1994]). Annexin VII interacts with the calcium-binding proteins Cbp2 ([/gene/DDB_G0267456 cbp2]) and Alg-2 ([/gene/DDB_G0293530 pefB]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16762449 Marko et al. 2006]). <br />Annexin VII plays a role in cellular calcium ion homeostasis. On non-nutrient agar, development was delayed in ''nxnA'' null cells and a significant number of aggregates failed to form fruiting bodies. Growth, pinocytosis, phagocytosis, chemotaxis, and motility were not significantly affected when ''nxnA'' null cells were grown in axenic medium. However, when Ca2+ chelator EGTA was added to the growth medium to reduce Ca2+ concentration, ''nxnA'' cells were severely impaired in growth, motility and chemotaxis. Exocytosis of secreted enzymes was not significantly altered in EGTA-treated ''nxnA'' null cells compared with wt; however, the total amounts of these enzymes were lower in the mutant than in the wild type. These results suggest that annexin VII is not required for membrane fusion, but rather for cellular Ca2+ homeostasis. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7657724 Doring et al. 1995]). Annexin VII accumulates at cell membrane wound sites, and in ''nxnA'' cells, there is defective cell membrane wound repair suggesting a role for NxnA in this process ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29789591 Pervin et al. 2018]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 03-MAR-2021 RD

DDB_G0272032	Robert Dodson	''gefG'' encodes a Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF, RasGEF). rasGEFs are key components of signaling networks in which they activate Ras family small GTPases by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP. GefG contains two F-box domains, motifs associated with ubiquitination and protein breakdown rather than with upstream signaling. ''gefG'' is weakly expressed, and transcripts could only be detected at 12 and 14 hours of development. Growth, morphology, phototaxis and fruiting body morphology are normal in a ''gefG'' null mutant ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16086850 Wilkins et al. 2005)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 06-APR-2021 RD

DDB_G0285313	Robert Dodson	''cepH'' encodes the centrosomal protein Cep192. Despite low sequence similarity, Cep192 is an ortholog of human CEP192, which is involved in mitotic centrosome maturation and bipolar spindle assembly. Cep192 is an essential part of the outer layers of the centrosomal core and is present at mitotic spindle poles. Cep192 interacts with CDK5RAP2 ([/gene/DDB_G0282851 cepL]) and likely directly interacts with both CDK5RAP2 and CP91 ([/gene/DDB_G0275495 cepE]) in the centrosomal core. Both ''cepH'' over-expression mutants and ''cepH'' knockdown mutants displayed supernumerary cytosolic microtubule organizing centers, and ''cepH'' knockdown mutants also displayed an increased average DNA content. These results reveal Cep192 to be a major structural component of the outer core layers of the ''Dictyostelium'' centrosome and suggest that Cep192 is required for centrosome biogenesis and for the functional integrity of the corona [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19466752  (Schultz et al., 2009)], (Pitzen, et al. 2021, PMID: 34572033).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 06-OCT-2021 RD

DDB_G0284337	Robert Dodson	''cynA'' was identified in a screen to identify novel regulators based on the spatial distributions of GFP-tagged proteins in migrating cells. CynA (Callipygian) localizes to the rear of randomly migrating cells and the lagging edge membrane of cells migrating in a cAMP gradient, and it also accumulates at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. CynA is a member of the myotubularin phosphatase family and contains an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain followed by a WD40 domain. ''cynA'' is expressed at low levels in growing cells and transcription is up-regulated during development, reaching a peak at 8 hr. of starvation. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26130809  (Swaney et al. 2015)]. CynA binds phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2), and specifically to surface-tethered lipid vesicles containing PI(3,4)P2 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30194235  (Li et al. 2018)]. Aggregation is delayed in ''cynA'' null cells and the cells also have an aberrant morphology, being elongated and with protrusions around the lateral edges. Motile ''cynA'' null cells display decreased directional persistence and an irregular trajectory, and an increase in lateral pseudopodia during chemotaxis compared with wild type cells. ''cynA'' null cells appear to have a slightly prolonged and elevated actin response suggesting that the presence of CynA locally inhibits actin polymerization. These results indicate that CynA increases migration efficiency and plays a role in the establishment of cell polarity by regulating the localization of actin polymerization [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26130809  (Swaney et al. 2015)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 18-MAR-2022 RD
DDB_G0282055	Robert Dodson	''c2gapB'' encodes a putative Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP, rasGAP). RasGAPs are key components of signal transduction networks in which they inactivate Ras GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. C2gapB contains an N-terminal C2 domain followed by a C-terminal Ras GTPase-activating domain. C2gapB localizes to the membrane, at the base of macropinocytotic crowns and nascent macropinosomes, and is also associated strongly with the rear of cells. C2gapB binds phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate. In ''c2gapB'' null cells, active Ras patches cover most the cell perimeter instead of restricted localization as in wild type cells and Ras activity is significantly increased; however, a specific target Ras GTPase has not been identified. Elevated Ras activity in the null mutants results in a significant increase in random cell motility. These results indicate that C2gapB inhibits Ras activity at the rear of the cell and suggest that it is an important regulator of protrusion dynamics and motility. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30194235 Li et al. 2018]), (Erratum, Li, et al. 2018, PMID: 30322942).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 16-MAR-2022 RD
DDB_G0281891	Robert Dodson	''rbg3'' encodes a putative Rab GTPase-activating protein (GAP, rabGAP). RabGAPs are key components of signal transduction networks in which they inactivate Rab GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. Rbg3 belongs to the Rab-GTPase-TBC domain superfamily. Rbg3 was identified in a yeast two hybrid (Y2H) screen in which the active form of G-protein subunit alpha 2 ([/gene/DDB_G0276267 gpaB]) was used as bait. ''rbg3'' is expressed at low levels in the vegetative stage with a marginal increase during development; however Rbg3 protein levels remain constant throughout the life cycle. Rbg3 is localized to the cytosol, but in a cAMP gradient Rbg3 transiently localizes inside of the leading edge. Rbg3 interacts with G-protein subunit alpha 2 and G-protein subunit alpha 9 ([/gene/DDB_G0283419 gpaI]) suggesting that Rbg3 is potentially regulated via the activity of G-alpha 9 during growth and that of G-alpha 2 during development. Rbg3 is a possible RabGAP for ''rab7A'' ([/gene/DDB_G0269236 rab7A]). ''rbg3'' null cells have an increased growth rate, with increased cell numbers and increased cell density at stationary phase compared with wild type (wt). ''rbg3'' null cells develop precociously, completing development 4 hours faster than wt cells. ''rbg3'' null cells also showed enhanced cAMP levels. In contrast, ''rbg3'' overexpression mutants have a decreased growth rate and delayed development compared with wt cells. In addition, the size of lysosomes is increased in ''rbg3'' overexpression mutants. Both human and C. elegans ''rbg3'' homologs complemented the growth and development ''rbg3'' phenotypes in ''D. discoideum'', suggesting that a common functional role may exist for Rbg3 among multicellular organisms. These results suggest that ''rbg3'' is involved in signal transduction networks regulating growth, lysosome function and life-cycle duration ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24349132 Kuwayama et al. 2013]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 25-MAR-2022 RD; annotation contributions: PMID:24349132 Hidekazu Kuwayama

An RNA-sequencing approach was used to identify mTORC1/AMPK-regulated transcriptional networks and associated signaling pathways that are essential for early developmental induction. A combination of starvation and treatment with rapamycin was used to identify a set of ~500 transcripts upregulated during the transition from growth to development, among which is ''DDB_G0267942''. A ''DDB_G0267942'' null mutant is unable to aggregate and displays reduced expression of CAR1 ([/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1]), ([/gene/DDB_G0273533 carA-2]), supporting a role for DDB_G0267942 in the induction of early development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31319820  (Jaiswal and Kimmel, 2015)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 06-APR-2022 RD

DDB_G0269252	Robert Dodson	''gefE'' encodes a Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF, RasGEF). rasGEFs are key components of signaling networks in which they activate Ras family small GTPases by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP. The level of activated RasD ([/gene/DDB_G0292996 rasD]) is significantly lower in ''gefE'' null mutant cells, indicating that GefE has GEF activity towards RasD ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24282234 Chattwood et al. 2013)].<br />RasD and GefE together regulate phototaxis, thermotaxis and cell fate bias. ''gefE'' null mutant slugs are defective in both thermotaxis and phototaxis, migrating similar distances as wild type, but far less accurately towards the light source ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16086850 Wilkins et al. 2005)], similar to the phenotype of ''rasD'' null mutants ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10837033 Wilkins et al. 2000)]. To investigate the molecular basis of lineage priming and how it leads to reproducible cell type proportioning ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24282234  Chattwood et al. 2013) ] employed a genetic screen and identified two bias genes, ''gefE'' and ''rasD''. ''gefE'' null mutants formed more spores than wt cells, and in chimeric slugs labelled mutants are enriched in the prespore region, while cells expressing higher levels of GefE are found in prestalk regions of the slug. ''gefE'' null mutants are also less sensitive to DIF than wt ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24282234 Chattwood et al. 2013)]. ''rasD'' mutants exhibit similar phenotypes: ''rasD'' null cells exhibit a spore bias in chimeric mixtures with wild type cells, while constitutively active ''rasD'' cells exhibit a strong stalk bias ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30473004 Gruenheit et al. 2018)]. Expression of GefE is required to activate RasD in a subset of cells, which in turn sets the threshold at which these cells respond to the pstB/pstO differentiation inducer DIF, indicating that GefE acts through ''rasD'' to promote prestalk cell fate choice. Although ''gefE'' expression is uniform in all cells during growth, transcription of ''rasD'' is both heterogeneous and dynamic, thus providing a novel mechanism for heterogeneity generation and position-independent differentiation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24282234 Chattwood et al. 2013)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30473004 Gruenheit et al. 2018)]. The confinement of Ras activation to the membrane region at the source of cAMP stimulus is abolished in both ''gefD'' ([/gene/DDB_G0289667 gefD]) and ''gefE'' null mutants, suggesting that ''gefD'' and ''gefE'' contribute to restrict activation of Ras to the front of chemotaxing cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23886948 Kortholt et al. 2013]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 30-MAR-2021 RD
DDB_G0271868	Robert Dodson	''gefS'' encodes a Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF, RasGEF). rasGEFs are key components of signaling networks in which they activate Ras family small GTPases by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP. Expression of ''gefS'' during growth is hardly detectable, and ''gefS'' is weakly expressed between 12 and 14 hours of development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16086850 Wilkins et al. 2005)]. GefS is phosphorylated by PKB ([/gene/DDB_G0290157 pkgB]) in response to chemoattractant stimulation by cAMP ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18635356 Kamimura et al. 2008)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19763972 Kamimura et al. 2009)], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30617109 Williams et al. 2019)]. GefS shows prolonged phosphorylation in ''pten'' ([/gene/DDB_G0286557 pten]) null cells. However ''gefS'' null cells display no obvious phenotypes, and there were no significant differences in the phenotypes of ''pten''/''gefS'' double null mutants versus single ''pten'' null mutants ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21169559 Tang et al. 2010)]. ''gefS'' null mutants also did not display any fluid phase defect ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30617109 Williams et al. 2019)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 18-MAY-2021 RD
DDB_G0272632	Robert Dodson	''gstA2'' encodes the enzyme glutathione S-transferase. Glutathione S-transferase plays an important role in cellular metabolism and detoxification by catalyzing the conjugation of glutathione to electrophilic endobiotic and xenobiotic substrates to reduce their interaction with cellular macromolecules. The plant polyphenol curcumin induces a significant increase in ''gstA2'' expression ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26449461 Garige et al. 2015]). ''gstA2'' is expressed in vegetatively growing cells. ''gstA2'' expression decreases during early development, but increases during slug and fruiting body formation. RNAi-mediated knockdown of ''gstA2'' results in decreased cell proliferation. In addition, ''gstA2'' knockdown cells have developmental abnormalities starting at the slug stage, including abnormally thick slugs which failed to form mature fruiting bodies at 24 hours of development. These results demonstrate that ''gstA2'' plays a role in proliferation and late stage development (Garige, et al 2021, PMID:33909675). Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 22-JUL-2021 RD
DDB_G0281557	Robert Dodson	''lrrkA'' encodes a protein with a C-terminal kinase domain and an N-terminal domain consisting of 7 leucine-rich repeats. ''lrrkA'' was isolated from a collection of random insertion mutants as a mutant defective in growth on bacteria. ''lrrkA'' null cells grow poorly on a lawn of Gram-positive bacteria. In ''lrrkA'' null cells, intracellular killing of ''Klebsiella pneumoniae'' was significantly slower than in wild type cells; however, intracellular killing of ''Bacillus subtilis'' was just as efficient as in wild type cells. In addition, intracellular killng of ''Klebsiella pneumoniae'' was also significantly slower in ''lrrkA''/''kil2'' ([/gene/DDB_G0279183 kil2]) double null cells; however, no slower than in ''lrrkA'' null cells, suggesting that LrrkA and Kil2 play partially redundant roles in intracellular bacterial killing. Phagosomal proteolysis was less efficient in both ''lrrkA'' and ''kil2'' null cells. Intracellular killing of bacteria was not stimulated in ''lrrkA'' null cells upon exposure to folate. These results reveal a signaling pathway where folate is recognized at the cell surface by the folic acid receptor Far1 ([/gene/DDB_G0281211 far1]), leading to the sequential activation of LrrkA and Kil2 and increased intracellular killing of bacteria within phagosomes ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652367 Bodinier et al. 2019]). ''lrrkA'' null cells also display an increase in cell motility and an increase in the efficiency of phagocytosis, indicating that LrrkA is a negative regulator of cell motility and phagocytosis. In addition, folate increases motility in wt cells, but not in ''lrrkA'' null cells, further suggesting that LrrkA plays a role in the cellular response to folate. Taken together, these results suggest that LrrkA functions in two modes: in the absence of folate, LrrkA inhibits motility and phagocytosis, but does not stimulate killing of intracellular bacteria; however, in the presence of a high concentration of folate, Far1 activates LrrkA which in turn stimulates intracellular killing via activation of Kil2 (Bodinier et al. 2021, PMID:33763419).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 26-JUL-2021 RD
DDB_G0279823	Robert Dodson	Sey1 is an ortholog of yeast SEY1, a dynamin-like GTPase that mediates homotypic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) fusion. Sey1 consists of a large N-terminal guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) domain, followed by a three-helix bundle (3HB) domain, two adjacent transmembrane motifs (TMs), and a cytosolic C-terminal domain. Sey1 localizes to the ER as well as to ''Legionella''-containing vacuoles (LCV). ''sey1'' mutants reveal a role for Sey1 in ''Legionella pneumophila'' replication. Over-expression of Sey1 promotes the intracellular replication of ''L. pneumophila'' and LCVs with an enlarged diameter, whereas ''L. pneumophila'' growth is substantially decreased, and the diameter of LCVs is reduced in ''sey1'' mutant cells with abolished GTPase activity. In addition, the ER fails to accumulate around LCVs in catalytically inactive ''sey1'' mutants. These results reveal that Sey1 promotes intracellular replication of L. pneumophila by remodeling the ER connecting with the pathogen vacuole [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28835546  (Steiner et al. 2017)]. ''sey1'' null mutants have an altered ER architecture, with a partially disrupted tubular ER network. ''sey1'' null mutants also exhibit defects in lysosomal enzyme exocytosis, intracellular proteolysis, and cell motility, resulting in impaired growth on bacterial lawns. In ''sey1'' null mutants, the expansion of the LCV is inhibited at early stages of infection, the ER is less efficiently recruited to the LCV, and ''L. pneumophila'' replicates less efficiently and shows a severe growth defect compared with growth in wild type cells. These results further reveal a role for Sey1 in maintenance of the ER architecture and intracellular replication by ''L. pneumophila'' (Husler, et al. 2021, PMID:33583106).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 28-OCT-2021 RD
DDB_G0285973	Robert Dodson	''ttpA'' encodes an mRNA-binding protein of the tristetraproline (TTP) family. Eukaryotic orthologs of ''ttpA'' bind to AU-rich motifs in the 3 prime untranslated region (UTR) of mRNA, promoting mRNA de-adenylation and decay and inhibition of translation. ''Dictyostelium'' TtpA contains two tandem zinc-finger domains and was demonstrated to bind RNA. When ectopically expressed in mammalian cells, ''Dictyostelium'' TtpA promotes the decay of mRNA transcripts containing AU-rich binding motifs in their 3 prime UTRs. When grown in shaking liquid culture, ''ttpA'' null and loss-of-function mutants display a decrease in cell proliferation and enlarged nuclei; however, these phenotypes were not observed when the mutants were grown on plastic surfaces. The expression level of 3 genes was increased manyfold in ''ttpA'' null and loss-of-function mutants: ([/gene/DDB_G0283095 DD3-3]), ([/gene/DDB_G0281067 DDB_G0281067]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0282993 sodC]). In addition, ([/gene/DDB_G0289653 noxA]), ([/gene/DDB_G0267460 cybA]) and ([/gene/DDB_G0278313 DDB_G0278313]) expression levels were consistently elevated in the mutant cells. All six target transcripts encode putative membrane proteins and contain multiple TTP binding motifs (UUAUUUAUU) in their 3 prime UTRs. These results suggest that ''ttpA'' promotes mRNA de-adenylation and decay in a specific mRNA subclass and thus post-transcriptionally regulates the expression of functionally related proteins.

DDB_G0269140	Robert Dodson	''gapA'' (''iqgB'') was identified in a REMI screen for cytokinesis mutants ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7811269 Adachi et al. 1994]). The GapA (IQGAP2) protein contains a central Ras GTPase-activating domain followed by a C-terminal RasGAP domain, but RasGAP activity has not been demonstrated for GapA. GapA is present in the cytosol and cell cortex, and during cytokinesis translocates to the cleavage furrow. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21085675 Mondal et al. 2010]). GapA interacts with a number of Rac small GTPases, including Rho GTPase Rac1A ([/gene/DDB_G0277869 rac1A]) and Rac1B ([/gene/DDB_G0268622 rac1B]) and interacts specifically with activated Rac1A. GapA forms oligomers and also interacts with a number of additional proteins, including the actin-binding protein filamin ([/gene/DDB_G0269100 abpC]) and the actin-bundling protein cortexillin ctxA ([/gene/DDB_G0289483 ctxA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20375144 Lee et al. 2010]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21085675 Mondal et al. 2010]).<br />''gapA'' null mutants have multiple phenotypes. ''gapA'' null mutant cells have a cytokinesis defect in which daughter cells fail to separate, remaining linked by a thin cytoplasmic bridge and resulting in multinucleate cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7811269 Adachi et al. 1994]), ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9151691 Adachi et al. 1997]). ''gapA'' null cells also display a decreased ability to suppress lateral pseudopodia, and thus reduced directionality during chemotaxis to cAMP, aberrant F-actin organization, increased myosin II assembly, and have multiple, F-actin-enriched small projections, which may be filopodia. A double mutant of ''gapA''/''rgaA'' (IQGAP1) ([/gene/DDB_G0287585 rgaA]) has a more severe chemotaxis defect ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20375144 Lee et al. 2010]) and a more severe cytokinesis defect ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11447112 Faix et al. 2001]) than either single mutant. In addition, ''gapA'' null cells have a defect in response to mechanical stress that is not observed in ''gapA''/''rgaA'' double null mutants, indicating that GapA maintains myosin II ([/gene/DDB_G0286355 mhcA]) and cortexillin I mechanosensing by suppressing IQGAP1 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22379107 Kee et al. 2012]). ''gapA'' null cells have a lower F-actin content than wt cells. Overexpression of filamin partially rescues the ''gapA'' null cytokinesis defect ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21085675 Mondal et al. 2010]). Taken together, these results reveal that GapA plays a role in cytokinesis, chemotaxis and mechanical stress sensing. Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 11-MAR-2022 RD
DDB_G0282847	Robert Dodson	''rab5B'' encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Rab family of small GTPases. G proteins are key components of signal transduction networks in which they function as molecular signaling switches, binding to GDP in the off state while binding GTP in the on state. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rab GTPases thus activating them, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Rab GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. Rab subfamily small GTPases in many organisms are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking. Proteomic analysis revealed that Rab5B is localized to the Legionella-containing vacuole [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28183814  (Schmolders et al. 2017)] and also to lipid droplets ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24036346 Du, et al. 2013]). Rab5B lacks two carboxyl-terminal cysteine residues conserved in other Rab proteins which are subject to isoprenylation and serve as a lipid anchor to cell membranes. Rab GAP TbcrA ([/gene/DDB_G0282575 tbcrA]) binds to and is a possible RabGAP for Rab5B (Tu, et al 2022, PMID:35379834).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 20-APR-2022 RD
DDB_G0282247	Robert Dodson	''rapgapB'' encodes a Rap GTPase-activating protein (GAP, rapGAP). RapGAPs are key components of signal transduction networks in which they inactivate Rap GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. RapGAPB belongs to the Rap/Ran-GAP superfamily. ''rapGAPB'' is expressed during multicellular development and is enriched in prestalk cells with highest expression in the prestalk (pstO) region of slugs and in the upper and lower cups of culminants. In response to cAMP stimulation, ''rapgapB'' null cells display increased levels of active Rap GTPase RapA (Rap1) ([/gene/DDB_G0291237 rapA]) and the time course of RapA deactivation is dramatically decreased, indicating that RapGAPB has specific GAP activity for RapA.<br />''rapgapB'' null cells attach more strongly to the substratum than wild-type (wt) cells and display aberrant actin filament organization, with actin decorating the periphery of cells within filopodia. Aggregation is aberrant in ''rapgapB'' null cells with aggregation streams tending to break up resulting in large numbers of small mounds. The mutants form large numbers of misshapen tipped mound structures, and appear unable to form migratory slugs although small, twisted fruiting bodies eventually form. ''rapgapB'' null cells also have defects in pre-stalk cell patterning, as both pstA and pstO cells are mislocalized in the mutant cells. In addition, ''rapgapB'' null cells exhibit defects in cell-type-specific cell-cell adhesion: null mutant prestalk cells are less adhesive than wt prestalk cells but null mutant prespore cells are more adhesive than wt prespore cells, suggesting that changes in cell adhesion may underlie the ''rapgapB'' null mutant sorting defects. These results indicate that ''rapgapB'' is involved in the regulation of cell-substrate adhesion, aggregation and actin filament organization through the mediation of RapA activation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19126673 Parkinson et al. 2009]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 30-MAR-2022 RD
DDB_G0282575	Robert Dodson	''tbcrA'' encodes a Rab GTPase-activating protein (GAP, rabGAP). RabGAPs are key components of signal transduction networks in which they inactivate Rab GTPases by binding to them and promoting their intrinsic GTPase activity to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. TbcrA contains an an N-terminal Regulator of chromosome condensation (RCC1) domain and a C-terminal Rab-GTPase-TBC domain. TbcrA was identified as an interactor of PripA ([/gene/DDB_G0275795 pripA]) during a screen for proteins that localize to the macropinosome during the macropinosome maturation process. TbcrA localizes to both macropinosomes and phagosomes, and colocalizes with PripA on macropinosomes. TbcrA also interacts with and has GAP activity towards the Rab GTPase Rab5A ([/gene/DDB_G0271984 rab5A]). In both ''pripA'' and ''tbcrA'' null cells, there is decreased inactivation of Rab5A, suggesting that PripA and TbcrA function in a complex. In addition, both ''tbcrA'' and ''pripA'' null cells have delayed macropinocytic and phagocytic cargo degradation. Taken together, these results support a role for the PripA-TbcrA complex in regulating macropinosome maturation by linking early and late macropinocytic compartments and promoting the fusion of Rab5 ([/gene/DDB_G0271984 rab5A])-marked early macropinosomes to Rab7 ([/gene/DDB_G0269236 rab7A])-marked late macropinosomes (Tu, et al 2022, PMID:35379834).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 20-APR-2022 RD
