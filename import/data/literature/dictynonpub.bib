Gene models consist of the translational start and stop sites site, as well as  intron/exon boundaries. The Gene Predictions from the Sequencing Center are evaluated using biological information (mRNA and ESTs) and comparison with sequences from other organisms.  If the Gene Prediction from the Sequencing Center is consistent with available evidence, that gene model is upgraded to a Curated Model.  If evidence suggests that the Gene Prediction needs modification, the Curated Model coordinates are changed to reflect the supporting data.  In cases where the gene model is highly plausible but lacks supporting evidence for the entire length of the gene, a note will appear indicating that 'the supporting evidence for this gene model is incomplete.'  Genes that have been manually inspected but do not have a Curated Model lack sufficient evidence to allow the curator to create an accurate Curated Model.  In this case, a curator note describes the discrepancy on the Gene Page.},

    The cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum grows as unicellular free-living amoebae in the presence of nutrients. Upon starvation, the amoebae aggregate and form multicellular structures that each consist of a stalk and spores. D. discoideum encodes at least four proteins (Sir2A, Sir2B, Sir2C, and Sir2D) homologous to human SIRT. RT-PCR and WISH analyses showed that the genes for Sir2A, Sir2C, and Sir2D were expressed at high levels in growing cells but at decreased levels in developing cells, whereas the gene encoding Sir2B was expressed in the prestalk-cell region in the developmental phase.

year = {2003},
abstract = {A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a statistical representation of patterns found in a data set. When using HMMs with proteins, the HMM is a statistical model of the patterns of the amino acids found in a multiple alignment of a set of proteins called the "seed". Seed proteins are chosen based on sequence similarity to each other. Seed members can be chosen with different levels of relationship to each other. They can be members of a superfamily (ex. ABC transporter, ATP-binding proteins), they can all share the same exact specific function (ex. biotin synthase) or they could share another type of relationship of intermediate specificity (ex. subfamily, domain). New proteins can be scored against the model generated from the seed according to how closely the patterns of amino acids in the new proteins match those in the seed. There are two scores assigned to the HMM which allow annotators to judge how well any new protein scores to the model. Proteins scoring above the "trusted cutoff" score can be assumed to be part of the group defined by the seed. Proteins scoring below the "noise cutoff" score can be assumed to NOT be a part of the group. Proteins scoring between the trusted and noise cutoffs may be part of the group but may not. One of the important features of HMMs is that they are built from a multiple alignment of protein sequences, not a pairwise alignment. This is significant, since shared similarity between many proteins is much more likely to indicate shared functional relationship than sequence similarity between just two proteins. The usefulness of an HMM is directly related to the amount of care that is taken in chosing the seed members, building a good multiple alignment of the seed members, assessing the level of specificity of the model, and choosing the cutoff scores correctly. In order to properly assess what functional relevance an above-trusted scoring HMM match has to a query, one must carefully determine what the functional scope of the HMM is. If the HMM models proteins that all share the same function then it is likely possible to assign a specific function to high-scoring match proteins based on the HMM. If the HMM models proteins that have a wide variety of functions, then it will not be possible to assign a specific function to the query based on the HMM match, however, depending on the nature of the HMM in question, it may be possible to assign a more general (family or subfamily level) function. In order to determine the functional scope of an HMM, one must carefully read the documentation associated with the HMM. The annotator must also consider whether the function attributed to the proteins in the HMM makes sense for the query based on what is known about the organism in which the query protein resides and in light of any other information that might be available about the query protein. After carefully considering all of these issues the annotator makes an annotation.},

title = {Pairwise alignment (TIGR)},
year = {2003},
abstract = {Pairwise alignments are generated by taking two sequences and aligning them so that the maximum number of amino acids in each protein match, or are similar to, each other. Tools such as BLAST work by comparing a protein-of-interest individually with every protein in a database of known protein sequences and retaining only those matches with a high probability of being significant. Basic BLAST generates local alignments between proteins for regions of high similarity. Other pairwise alignment tools attempt to generate global (full-length) protein alignments. A tool called Blast_Extend_repraze (BER, http://ber.sourceforge.net) has some benefits over basic BLAST. Input into the BER tool includes the underlying DNA sequence for each protein as well as 300 nucleotides upstream and downstream of the predicted boundaries of the protein coding sequence. This allows annotators to see the DNA sequence that underlies the query protein as part of the alignment. In addition, the BER tool is able to look for continuation of regions of similarity through frameshifts and in-frame stop codons.  If such regions are found the alignment is continued. BER searches are done in a two-step process: step one is a BLAST search against a non-redundant protein database, significant BLAST hits are stored in a mini-database for each query protein; step two is a modified Smith-Waterman alignment between the query and the proteins in its mini-database. In order to assess whether a given BER alignment is good enough to assert that the query shares the function of the match protein, one must look at a several factors. First of all, the match protein must itself be experimentally characterized in order to avoid transitive annotation errors. In addition, any residues or secondary structures known to be important for function in the match protein must be conserved in the query. The alignment should be visually inspected to look for any areas of lesser quality that might indicate the two proteins do not share the same function. Although it is impossible to set cutoff values for percent identity and length of match that will apply for every alignment, there are some guidelines. In general at least 40% identity that extends over the full lengths of both proteins is required in order to even consider functional equivalence. However, this percentage is highly dependent on the length and complexity of the proteins. 40% identity between two proteins 500 amino acids long is much more significant that 40% identity between two proteins that are only 100 amino acids long. Therefore, the annotator's experience and knowledge of what is considered significant for the organism and protein family in question is very important. Some sets of proteins are much more highly conserved than others and therefore tolerances for percent identity may have to be adjusted. Finally, the alignment must be considered in the context of what else is known about the query protein and the organism as a whole.},

year = {2011},
abstract = {Method for transferring manual annotations to an entry based on a curator's judgment of its similarity to a putative ortholog that has annotations that are supported with experimental evidence. Annotations are created when a curator judges that the sequence of a protein shows high similarity to another protein that has annotation(s) supported by experimental evidence (and therefore display one of the evidence codes EXP, IDA, IGI, IMP, IPI or IEP). Annotations resulting from the transfer of GO terms display the 'ISS' evidence code and include an accession for the protein from which the annotation was projected in the 'with' field (column 8). This field can contain either a UniProtKB accession or an IPI (International Protein Index) identifier. Only annotations with an experimental evidence code and which do not have the 'NOT' qualifier are transferred. Putative orthologs are chosen using information combined from a variety of complementary sources. Potential orthologs are initially identified using sequence similarity search programs such as BLAST. Orthology relationships are then verified manually using a combination of resources including sequence analysis tools, phylogenetic and comparative genomics databases such as Ensembl Compara, INPARANOID and OrthoMCL, as well as other specialised databases such as species-specific collections (e.g. HGNC's HCOP). In all cases curators check each alignment and use their experience to assess whether similarity is considered to be strong enough to infer that the two proteins have a common function so that they can confidently project an annotation. While there is no fixed cut-off point in percentage sequence similarity, generally proteins which have greater than 30% identity that covers greater than 80% of the length of both proteins are examined further. For mammalian proteins this cut-off tends to be higher, with an average of 80% identity over 90% of the length of both proteins. Strict orthologs are desirable but not essential. When there is evidence of paralogs, annotations are transferred only to the most similar protein in each species. Further detailed information on this procedure, including how ISS annotations are made to protein isoforms, can be found at: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA/ISS_method.html.},

title = {Operon structure as IGC evidence},
year = {2007},
abstract = {Genes in prokaryotic organisms are often arranged in operons. Genes in an operon are all transcribed into one mRNA. Generally the genes in the operons code for proteins that all have related functions. For example, they may be the steps in a biochemical pathway, or they may be the subunits of a protein complex. Often the genes in operons shared between organisms are syntenic; that is, the same genes are in the same order in the operon in different species. When assessing sequence-comparison-based evidence during the process of manual annotation of a genome, it is often the case that some of the genes in the operon will have strong sequence-based evidence while others will have weak evidence. If seen alone, not in the presence of an operon, the weak evidence in question may not be sufficient to make a functional annotation. However, in the presence of an operon in which there is strong evidence for some of the genes, the very presence of the gene in the operon is a strong indication that the gene shares in the process carried out by the operon. If the putative function is one expected to exist for the process in question and particularly if that function has been observed in the same operon in another species, then the annotation should be made. This type of evidence is inferred from the context of the gene in an operon, and therefore the evidence code is IGC "inferred from genomic context."},

abstract = {A meeting focused on the biology of skeletal and smooth muscle has been held on 24-25 July 2007 at the University of Padua, Italy, as a collaboration with the GO consortium and CRIBI Biotechnology Center. The aims of this effort were to provide a comprehensive representation of muscle biology in the biological process and cellular component ontologies and to improve the organization of muscle-specific terms to better describe the current knowledge of biological mechanisms in muscle tissue. Thus, the collaboration brought together experts in several areas of muscle biology and physiology who carried out a thorough review of the existing GO muscle terms as these terms were largely created by non-muscle experts using older definitions. In particular, several areas are being addressed actively in current research: the biological processes of muscle contraction, muscle plasticity, muscle development, and muscle regeneration; and the sarcoplasmic reticulum and membrane delimited compartments. This work resulted in the addition of 159 new terms and in the modification of 57 terms to bring them in line with current usage. Funding for the meeting was provided by Italian Telethon Foundation.},

Standard BLASTP from NCBI was used (http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/blast) to iteratively search reciprocal best hits and thus identify orthologs between predicted proteins of Magnaporthe grisea and GO proteins from multiple organisms with published association to GO terms (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.downloads.database.shtml). The alignments were manually reviewed for those hits with e-value equal to zero and with 80% or better coverage of both query and subject sequences, and for those hits with e<=10^-20, pid >=35 and sequence coverage >=80%. Furthermore, experimental or reviewed data from literature and other sources were incorporated into the GO annotation. IDA was assigned to an annotation if normal function of its gene was determined through transfections into a cell line and overexpression. IEP was assigned to an annotation if according to microarray experiments, its gene was upregulated in a biological process and the fold change was equal to or bigger than 10, or if according to Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS), its gene was upregulated only in a certain biological process and the fold change was equal to or bigger than 10. ISS was assigned to an annotation if the entry at the With_column was experimentally characterized and the pairwise alignments were manually reviewed. IGC was assigned to an annotation if it based on comparison and analysis of gene location and structure, clustering of genes, and phylogenetic reconstruction of these genes. RCA was assigned to an annotation if it based on integrated computational analysis of whole genome microarray data, and matches to InterPro, pfam, and COG etc. When no knowledge (experimental/computational) was available about a gene product in any one of the GO aspects, the gene product was annotated to the root term (GO:0005575 for Cellular Component, GO:0003674 for Molecular Function, and GO:0008150 for Biological Process), and was assigned an ND evidence code. IEA was assigned to an annotation if its function assignment based on computational work, and no manual review was done.},

The first is the set of conditions that must be met for the rule to fire. The second is the set actions to be taken for rules that have fired. BGRB rules are designed to serve as proxies for the annotators that create them. They have very high fidelity but may have low coverage. Types of evidence used in combination include HMM hits and BLAST matches, hits to neighboring genes, pathway reconstruction reports from the Genome Properties system, and species taxonomy. BLAST matches are described by a number of separate parameters for raw score, percent sequence identity, and coverage of total sequence length by the match region. These parameters are customized for each protein family in order to achieve high fidelity in automated annotation systems. The flexible syntax makes it possible to use existing protein family classifiers, such as Pfam and TIGRFAMs HMMs, in new ways. It is especially useful in assigning GO terms to proteins such as SelD (selenide, water dikinase) that have different roles in different contexts.},

It is preferable to cite a peer-reviewed publication (such as a PubMed identifier) for IKR-evidenced annotations whenever possible. Curators will have carefully reviewed the sequence of the annotated protein, and established that the key residues known to be required for an expected activity or location are not present.

A statistical model of a sequence or group of sequences is used to make a prediction about the function of a protein or RNA. Annotations are created when a curator evaluates the results, using criteria that include excluding false positives and ensuring that the annotation is accurate for all matches. Statistical scores (such as e values and cutoff scores) and the functional specificity of the model may also be (but are not always) considered. Annotations resulting from the transfer of GO terms use the 'ISM' evidence code and include an accession for the model from which the annotation was projected in the 'with' field (column 8).},
