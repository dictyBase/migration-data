DBP0000045	pMB38	pMB38 is a cloning vector for the gene of interest.    Extrachromosomal response plasmid containing the inducible promoter TRE-P<sub>min</sub> upstream of the 2H3T terminator with 4 unique restriction sites in between.    Both tetON and tetOFF systems exist for Dicty. The tetOFF system was pioneered by Dingermann and colleagues, but the most frequently used  vectors are those constructed by Blaauw et al., Gene 252:71-82, 2000.  The Dicty tetON system is derived from yeast vectors described in Urlinger  et al., PNAS 97:7963-8, 2000; the rtTa-M2 element was recloned into the Blaauw vector MB35 by Adriano Ceccarelli, and students in my lab have shown that the performance of this tetON system in Dicty (induction  factor, response time) is similar to that of the tetOFF system.    Both the original tetOFF MB35 and its tetON version are neo vectors. In practice one needs a Dicty strain carrying one or the other of these, which one overtransforms with a second, blasticidin vector (Blauuw et al. MB38) carrying the gene of interest. Once one has cloned one's gene into MB38, it can be overtransformed into both tetON and tetOFF strains. Both MB35 and MB38 are in the stock center, as are cells containing MB35. H. MacWilliams

DBP0000118	pVEII	inducible gene expression vector containing the discoidin gamma promoter; constructed by replacing the act6 promoter in pDnNeo2. <br/><br/> Transformation vector which can be used for expression of genes from the discoidin I gamma promoter. The vector contains a multiple cloning site for inserting the gene of interest. The discoidin ATG is located upstream of the MCS. We recommend sequencing the junction of the insert using a primer within the promoter. The oligo: 5'-GAA AAA TTA AAA TTT CAT ACA AAT TAT C-3' worked well for us; you can start reading at the ATG - XbaI site.  <br/><br/>  Regulation of the promoter is described in Vauti et al., Mol. Cell. BioI. 8, 4080-4088, 1990. The paper by Blusch et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 20, 6235-6238, 1992 describes use of pVEII as an inducible expression system. This has now been working for several people (e.g. M. Clarke, G. Weeks). In addition, Dictyostelium cells with altered discoidin expression can be used to get higher or lower expression. These mutant strains can be obtained from B. Wetterauer and H. MacWilliams (PMID 8464730 and PMID 8396055). <b> Sequence note: </b> This sequence has been provided by Piero Morandini and Klaus Salger.

DBP0000264	pMB35-M2	tetON drive; both tetON and tetOFF systems exist for Dicty. The tetOFF system was pioneered by Dingermann and colleagues, but the most frequently used  vectors are those constructed by Blaauw et al., Gene 252:71-82, 2000.  The Dicty tetON system is derived from yeast vectors described in Urlinger  et al., PNAS 97:7963-8, 2000; the rtTa-M2 element was recloned into the Blaauw vector MB35 by Adriano Ceccarelli, and students in my lab have shown that the performance of this tetON system in Dicty (induction  factor, response time) is similar to that of the tetOFF system.    Both the original tetOFF MB35 and its tetON version are neo vectors. In practice one needs a Dicty strain carrying one or the other of these, which one overtransforms with a second, blasticidin vector (Blauuw et al. MB38) carrying the gene of interest. Once one has cloned one's gene into MB38, it can be overtransformed into both tetON and tetOFF strains. Both MB35 and MB38 are in the stock center, as are cells containing MB35. H. MacWilliams

DBP0000824	pAmpA-mRFP	The mRFP-AmpA plasmid was constructed so that the AmpA hydrophobic leader sequence (MLNKLILLLILSSCLVLSVKSEV ? predicted cleavage site underlined) preceded the mRFP coding sequence (Fischer et al 2004) which was followed by the remainder of the AmpA coding sequence starting with the amino acid ?N? which immediately follows the hydrophobic leader. A BglII(ampA promoter region) ?Age I (AmpA coding region well C-terminal to the hydrophobic leader) fragment containing the hydrophobic leader-mRFP fused in frame to ampA coding sequence was cloned into the BglII ?AgeI site in a genomic copy of the full length ampA gene in pGem3 (pGem3-C12) to replace the endogenous Bgl II-Age I fragment and the floxed blastocidin cassette from pLPBLP (Kimmel 2006) was inserted in the multiple cloning site at the Pst1-Xma1 site.

The NDMko plasmid was removed using ClaI to include flanking gene DNA, sufficient to create future ndm gene knockouts.
DBP0000829	pSma-mRFP	The plasmid was used for a knock-in gene replacement of   DDB_G0281803/sma, such that the product would contain a C-terminal mRFP tag. The SMAmRFP plasmid contains a 3? coding region and a non-coding region sequence for promoting homologous recombination.  The coding region is followed in frame by the mRFPmars coding sequence at the carboxy terminus of the protein.  Following the mRFPmars coding region is a 270 bp AmpA terminator sequence.  The plasmid also contains a floxed blasticidin resistant cassette inserted at the SmaI site for selection.

DBP0000983	pPB86	Recently, Roux and co-workers published a method of proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID), which is especially useful to identify putative interactors of insoluble proteins [Roux, 2012]. In this method bait proteins are tagged with a point mutated version of the E. coli biotinylase BirA (BirA-R118G), which promiscuously biotinylates any target protein in close proximity in vivo. Biotinylated proteins can then be identified and purified using suitable streptavidin conjugates and affinity chromatography media.   This BirA-R118G vector for N-terminal fusions is based on the GFP-Vectors pIS76 (Bla). The complete BirA-R118G sequence flanked by NheI and SalI restriction sites was custom synthesized (GenArt, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), whereby each codon was replaced by the most common one based on the Dictyostelium codon bias table published on the genome project website (www.dictybase.org). GFP in pIS76 was then replaced by BirA-R118G using the NheI and SalI restriction sites yielding pPB86.  This vector can be used for overexpression of BirA-R118G fusion proteins in Dictyostelium. The well-characterized actin6-promoter was chosen to drive expression of the bait protein, since its activity can be controlled by cell culture conditions. This vector can be used for BioID in Dictyostelium.    Partental vector: pIS76; Insert/Vector Length: Insert BirA-R118G(991bp), vector 6012bp
