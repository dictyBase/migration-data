To do this, our core research is focused on fundamental biomedical discovery, using genetic, biochemical, and cell biophysical approaches and small molecule screening with the model organism Dictyostelium discoideum. We have also focused heavily on cytokinesis as a model cell morphogenic event. Cytokinesis naturally encapsulates numerous essential aspects of cell shape control, which are at the heart of many normal and disease processes. We then apply our knowledge, tools, and reagents to the study of a variety of human diseases, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and degenerative motor neuron disease. To accomplish such broad efforts, we collaborate closely with engineering and clinical research colleagues in order to facilitate these expansive aspects of our research."

Solid-state investigations revealed that &#946;-chitin is present in mollusk shells in highly ordered arrays with a preferred orientation over length scales of several microns. The chitin fibers are well aligned under individual crystal tablets in nacre with respect to certain crystallographic axes of the aragonite mineral phase. As the enzyme complex responsible for chitin deposition in the mollusk shell remained unknown, we cloned and characterized the chitin synthase of the marine bivalve mollusk Atrina rigida (ORF ~7.8kb; MW: 264kDa). We found that this is the first chitin synthase sequence from invertebrates containing an unconventional myosin motor head domain. The presence of an intracellular myosin domain in the transmembrane mollusk chitin synthase raises new questions regarding the cellular control of biomineralization. This complex chitin synthase is a strong candidate for bridging cellular signalling, cytoskeleton mechanics, extracellular matrix self-assembly, and mineralization. Cellular control over chitin self-assembly and modification might contribute to implement hierarchical features into the resulting composite material. We aim to express the mollusk myosin chitin synthase heterologously in Dictyostelium for further characterization."

Understanding the morphogenesis of an organism, the collective self-organization of cells that gives rise to a functional structure is at the heart of decoding life. We aim to identify the rules of development by studying the physical principles underlying the formation and adaptation of biological organisms. Currently we investigate the mechanics of plant growth and the fluid dynamics enabling the slime mold Physarum polycephalum to adapt its network-like body to its environment. Our approach is primarily theoretical but closely interacting with experiments."

Reason for choosing this gene by our group is as - human monoamine oxidase has two isoforms MAO-A & B which involves in catecholamine degradation. Mutation in their genes lead to many neurological disorders like depression, parkinsonism etc. But in dictyostelium there are 4 isoforms of MAO and the presence of catecholamine is not reported. Hence our group focus on elucidating functional role of these gene in dictyostelium and also we are try to develop dictyostelium as model for parkinson's disease."

We have identified a molecular mechanism that is centered on O2- and alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent prolyl hydroxylation of Skp1, an adaptor in the major SCF class of E3-polyubiquitin ligases. Hydroxylation of Pro-143 enables subsequent glycosylation by a series of 5 glycosyltransferase reactions, whose end effect is to promote assembly of the SCF complex. This is in turn is expected to promote turnover of proteins whose exit are necessary for developmental progression. The Dictyostelium system serves as a useful model for a related mechanism that is shared by a diverse set of unicellular eukaryotes."

Research in my lab is focused on understanding how cells establish and maintain polarity during chemotaxis (directed cell migration) and also during cytokinesis (cell division). We have found that the underlying mechanisms regulating both processes are remarkably similar. In fact, the directed migration process likely biases the same machinery regulating morphological changes which take place during cell division. Microfluidics and advanced techniques in fluorescence microscopy are being used to visualize these proteins and their localization under various conditions in the living cell and in living animals."

In particular, examining the chemotaxis of social amoebas gives students a chance to think integratively about a number of cell-biological phenomena, in the context of ""real world"" organismal behaviour. Then, in the summer of 2018, Jonathan Moore, Melissa Petreaca, and David Knecht published a marvelous guide to running an extended inquiry into Dicty chemotaxis for introductory cell biology students. (ABLE Conference Proceedings, 39:13, 2018) That was just the thing a neophyte like me needed, so I'm going to give it a go."
